## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow responsible disclosure practices.

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Email your findings to: `security@your-domain.com`
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Any suggested fixes

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of your report
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 24-72 hours
  - High: 1-2 weeks
  - Medium: 2-4 weeks
  - Low: Next release cycle

### Disclosure Policy

- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will credit you in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We ask that you do not publicly disclose until we've had time to address the issue

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
   - Use environment variables or `config/config.yaml` (gitignored)
   - Rotate keys if accidentally exposed

2. **Splunk Credentials**: Use token-based authentication when possible
   - Tokens can be scoped and revoked
   - Avoid using admin credentials

3. **Generated Queries**: Always review AI-generated SPL queries before running in production
   - The agent generates queries based on AI models
   - Validate queries in a test environment first

4. **IOC Processing**: Be cautious with untrusted URLs/PDFs
   - The agent fetches and processes external content
   - Only process reports from trusted sources

### For Developers

1. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Input Validation**: The agent validates inputs, but always sanitize user data

3. **Logging**: Avoid logging sensitive information (API keys, credentials)

## Scope

The following are in scope for security reports:

- Authentication/authorization bypass
- Injection vulnerabilities (SPL injection, command injection)
- Sensitive data exposure
- Insecure dependencies with known CVEs
- Cryptographic issues

Out of scope:

- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- Denial of service (unless trivially exploitable)
- Issues in third-party dependencies (report to maintainers directly)
