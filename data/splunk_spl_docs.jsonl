{"id": "9832fdbe81d2a801", "content": "When you run a search, the Splunk software uses the information in the index files to identify which events to retrieve from disk. The smaller the number of events to retrieve from disk, the faster the search runs. How you construct your search has a significant impact on the number of events retrieved from disk. When data is indexed, the data is processed into events based on time. The processed data consists of several files: The raw data in compressed form ( rawdata ) The indexes that point to the raw data ( index files , also referred to as tsidx files ) Some metadata files These files are written to disk and reside in sets of directories, organized by age, called buckets. Use indexes effectively One method to limit the data that is pulled off from disk is to partition data into separate indexes. If you rarely search across more than one type of data at a time, partition different types of data into separate indexes. Then restrict your searches to the specific index. For example, store web access data in one index and firewall data in another. Use separate indexes for sparse data, which might otherwise be buried in a large volume of unrelated data.

{"id": "2edab9ad23a9afc7", "content": "Some frequently used searches unnecessarily consume a significant amount of system resources. You will learn how optimizing just one search can save significant system resources. A frequently used search One search that is frequently used is a search that contains a lookup and an evaluation, followed by another search. For example: The following diagram shows a simplified, visual representation of this search. When the search is run, the index is accessed and 1 million events are extracted based on the source type. In the next part of the search, the lookup and eval command are run are on all 1 million events. Both the lookup and eval commands add columns to the events, as shown in the following image. Finally, a second search command runs against the columns A, L, and E. For column A, the search looks for values that are equal to 25. For column L, which was added as a result of the lookup command, the search looks for values greater than 100. For column E, which was added as a result of the eval command, the search looks for values that are greater than 50. Events that match the criteria for columns A, L, and E are identified, and 50,000 events that match the search criteria are returned. The following image shows the entire process and the resource costs involved in this inefficient search. An optimized search You can optimize the entire search by moving some of the components from the second search to locations earlier in the search process. Moving the criteria A=25 before the first pipe filters the events earlier and reduces the amount of times that the index is accessed. The number of events extracted is 300,000. This is a reduction of 700,000 compared to the original search. The lookup is performed on 300,000 events instead of 1 million events. Moving the criteria L>100 immediately after the lookup filters the events further, reducing the number of events returned by 100,000. The eval is performed on 200,000 events instead of 1 million events. The criteria E>50 is dependent on the results of the eval command and cannot be moved. The results are the same as the original search. 50,000 events are returned, but with much less impact on resources. This is the optimized search.

See Select time ranges to apply to your search See Specify time modifiers in your search If you must use a broad time range, such as Last week or All time , then use other techniques to limit the amount of data retrieved from disk. Specify the index, source, or source type Understanding how your data is organized is important to optimizing your searches. Take the time to learn which indexes contain your data, the sources of your data, and the source types. Knowing this information about your data helps you narrow down your searches. Run the following search. This search not optimized, but it does provide an opportunity for you to learn about the data you have access to. In the Selected fields list, click on each type of field and look at the values for host, source, and sourcetype. In the Interesting fields list, click on the index field. Look at the names of the indexes that you have access to. Whenever possible, specify the index, source, or source type in your search. When Splunk software indexes data, it automatically tags each event with a number of fields. The index, source, and source type fields are added automatically to each event as default fields. A default field is an indexed field that the Splunk software recognizes in your event data at search time. The host, source, and source type fields describe where the event originated. Be specific Use the most specific terms in your search that you can. If possible, avoid using wildcard characters. For example, instead of using a wildcard character for a keyword: Use the specific keyword: Here is another example. Instead of using a wildcard character for field values: Specify each value: Combine a source type or an index with one or more field-value pairs. For example: This search retrieves events from only your web access logs. A wildcard character, access_*, is used in the field value to match any Apache web access source type. The source types can be access_common , access_combined , or access_combined_wcookie. Two specific field-value pairs are included in the search, status=200 and action=purchase. Limit the number of events retrieved By default, a Splunk search retrieves all events. However in some situations you might want to retrieve a sample set of events, instead of retrieving the entire event set. Limiting the number of events retrieved is useful in several situations: You are creating a search and want to determine if you are retrieving the correct events You need only a subset or sample set of events for your search You can specify a limit to the number of events retrieved in a couple of ways: Use the head command The head command retrieves only the most recent N events for a historical search, or the first N captured events for a realtime search. For example: Use event sampling Event sampling uses a ratio that you specify to select events. For example, if the sample ratio value is 100, each event has a 1 in 100 chance of being included in the result set. To learn more about event sampling and sampling ratios, see Event sampling. By default, event sampling is not active. You must specify a sampling ratio before you run your search. In Splunk Web, click the Sampling drop-down and choose a sampling ratio. Use the TERM directive to match terms that contain minor breakers The TERM directive is useful when you are searching for a term that contains minor breakers, such as periods or underscores, but does not contain major breakers. The term must be bound by major breakers, such as spaces or commas. For example, the IP address 192.0.2.255 contains the period (. ) minor breaker. If you specify TERM(192.0.2.255) , the Splunk software treats the IP address as a single term, instead of individual numbers. Using the TERM directive to search for terms that contain minor breakers improves search performance. See Event segmentation and searching. Avoid using NOT expressions More resources are used tracking NOT expressions than if you specify what you are looking for. Where ever possible, avoid using NOT expressions. For example, instead of using a string of NOT or != expressions such as: (NOT host=d NOT host=e) or (host!=d AND host!=e) Use the specific terms you are searching for: (host=a OR host=b OR host=c). To learn more, see Difference between NOT and !=. Don't overuse the OR operator While the OR operator can be useful for broadening your search to include multiple terms, overusing it can lead to inefficient searches. Each additional OR condition increases the complexity of the search, which can significantly impact search performance. Instead, try to refine your search criteria to be as specific as possible, using exact matches or other operators that can narrow down the results more effectively. You can also minimize the use of OR operators using other techniques, such as lookups , event types , or regular expressions.", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "source=*"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "*error"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "fatal_error"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "status=404 OR status=5*"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "status=404 OR status=500 OR status=503"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_* status=200 action=purchase"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_* | head 1000 ..."}], "tables": [], "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 4, "metadata": {"title": "Quick tips for optimization", "section_heading": "Limit the data from disk", "section_id": "id_4ddc2b31_32bd_41c8_9958_c55d61b40544--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/search-manual/10.2/optimize-searches/quick-tips-for-optimization", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > Search Manual > Optimize Searches", "manual": "search-manual", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:18:26.762257+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

Use field-value pairs before the first pipe Field-value pairs are indexed. Specifying field-value pairs before the first pipe is an efficient way to filter out events. For example, in the following search the term status=404 is in a separate search: Move the term status=404 before the first pipe: Here is another example. The second search includes the term clientip=\"10.0.0.0/8\". There is no reason to wait to filter on that term. Move the term clientip=\"10.0.0.0/8\" to filter out all other clientip addresses before the stats command. Use filtering commands before calculating commands Use filtering commands, such as where , before commands that perform calculations, such as eval. For example, this search has a where command after the eval command. The search does not require the results of the eval command before the where command is run. Move the where command to filter the results before the eval command is processed: Filter unnecessary fields from search results You can remove unnecessary fields from the search results by using commands such as fields. Removing extraneous fields from searches make them more efficient because search doesn't have to process superfluous data. Other search optimizations that work on a definite set of fields, such as predicate pushdown and transforming commands, already reduce the number of fields that are propagated and, therefore, can make the fields command less impactful.

Identify relationships based on the time proximity or geographic location of the events. Use this correlation in any security or operations investigation, where you might need to see all or any subset of events that take place over a given time period or location. Track a series of related events, which may come from separate IT systems and data sources, together as a single transaction. Identify the amount of time it took to complete the transaction and the number of events within a single transaction. Use a sub-search to take the results of one search and use them in another. Create conditional searches, where you see the results of a search only if the sub-search meets certain thresholds. Correlate your data to external sources with lookups. Use SQL-like inner and outer joins to link two completely different data sets together based on one or more common fields. This chapter discusses three methods for correlating or grouping events: Use time to identify relations between events Use subsearch to correlate events Use transactions to identify and group related events You can also use field lookups and other features of the search language. Depending on your search criteria and how you want to define your groupings, you may be able to use a search command, such as append , associate , contingency , join , or stats. Sometimes, there is no single command that you can use. If you're not sure where to start, the following flow chart can help you decide whether to use a lookup, define a transaction, or try another search command to define your event grouping. In most cases, you can accomplish more with the stats command or the transaction command ; and these are recommended over using the join and append commands.

This is true even if the commands that follow sort are distributable streaming commands, like the second where command in the search. Once search processing moves to the search head, it can't be moved back to the indexer.

{"id": "dcff15e8746d41a4", "content": "A streaming command operates on each event as it is returned by a search. Essentially one event in and one (or no) event out. For example, the eval command can create a new field, full_name , to contain the concatenation of the value in the first_name field, a space, and the value in the last_name field. The eval command evaluates each event without considering the other events. A non-streaming command requires the events from all of the indexers before the command can operate on the entire set of events. Many transforming commands are non-streaming commands. There are also several commands that are not transforming commands but are also non-streaming. These non-transforming, non-streaming commands are most often dataset processing commands. For example, before the sort command can begin to sort the events, the entire set of events must be received by the sort command.

When data is indexed, characters such as periods and underscores are recognized as minor breakers between terms. Use the TERM directive to ignore the minor breakers and match whatever is inside the parentheses as a single term. For example, the IP address 127.0.0.1 contains the period (. ) minor breaker. If you search for the IP address 127.0.0.1, Splunk software searches for 127 AND 0 AND 1 and returns events that contain those numbers anywhere in the event. If you specify TERM(127.0.0.1) , the search treats the IP address as a single term, instead of individual numbers, and returns all events that contain the IP address 127.0.0.1. The TERM directive only works for terms that are bounded by major or minor breakers, but the term you are searching for cannot contain major breakers. For example, you cannot use TERM to search for Maria Dubois because there is a space between the names. This is discussed in the examples later in this topic. When you use the TERM directive, the Splunk software expects to see the term you specify as a token in the lexicon in the .tsidx file.

For example: A search for the keyword AND without meaning the Boolean operator: error \"AND\" A search for this field-value phrase: error \"startswith=Error\" The backslash character ( \\ ) is used to escape quotes, pipes, and itself. Backslash escape sequences are still expanded inside quotes. For example: The sequence \\| as part of a search will send a pipe character to the command, instead of having the pipe split between commands. The sequence \\\" will send a literal quote to the command, for example for searching for a literal quotation mark or inserting a literal quotation mark into a field using rex. The \\\\ sequence will be available as a literal backslash in the command. If Splunk software does not recognize a backslash sequence, it will not alter it.

{"id": "e8f5f9aef7f1a08e", "content": "Events and results flowing through the Splunk search pipeline exist as a collection of fields. Fields can fundamentally come from the Splunk index, for example, _time as the time of the event, source as the filename, and so on. Or can be derived from a wide variety of sources at search time, such as eventtypes, tags, regex extractions using the rex command, totals coming from the stats command, and so on. For a given event, a given field name might be present or absent. If present, it might contain a single value or multiple values. Each value is a text string. Values might be of positive length (a string, or text) or zero length (empty strings, or \"\" ). Numbers, for example, are strings that contain the number. For example, a field containing a value of the number 10 contains the characters 1 and 0: \"10\". Commands that take numbers from values automatically convert them internally to numbers for calculations. Null field A null field is not present on a particular result or event. Other events or results in the same search might have values for this field. For example, the fillnull command adds a field and default value to events or results that lack fields present on other events or results in the search. Empty field An empty field is shorthand for a field that contains a single value that is the empty string. Empty value A value that is the empty string, or \"\". You can also describe this as a zero-length string. Multivalue field A field that contains more than one value.

{"id": "2ce52283307b7b07", "content": "The backslash character ( \\ ) is used in regular expressions to escape any special characters that have meaning in regular expressions, such as periods (. ), double quotation marks ( \" ), and backslashes themselves. For example, the period character is used in a regular expression to match any character, except a line break character. If you want to match a period character, you must escape the period character by specifying \\. in your regular expression. In searches that include a regular expression that contains a double backslash, like the file path c:\\\\temp , the search interprets the first backslash as a regular expression escape character. The file path is interpreted as c:\\temp , because one of the backslashes is removed. You must escape both backslash characters in the file path by specifying 4 consecutive backslashes for the root portion of the file path, such as c:\\\\\\\\temp. For a longer file path, such as c:\\\\temp\\example , you can specify c:\\\\\\\\temp\\\\example in your regular expression in the search string. One reason you might need extra escaping backslashes in your searches is that the Splunk platform parses text twice; once for SPL and then again for regular expressions. Each parse applies its own use of backslashes in layers and treats each backslash as a special character that needs an additional backslash to make it literal. As a result, \\\\ in SPL becomes \\ before it is parsed as a regular expression, and \\\\\\\\ in SPL becomes \\\\ before it is parsed as a regular expression. See Backslashes. Avoid extra escaping backslash characters To avoid using extra escaping backslashes in your searches, you can use the octal code \\134 or the hexadecimal code \\x5c in your regular expression. These codes are equivalent to the backslash character and get around the need to double-escape backslashes. For example, consider the following search, which extracts the characters ABC that follow 2 backslashes: The search results look something like this: Instead of using 3 backslashes, you can get the same search results using \\x5c in the regular expression, like this:", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalexample=\"xyz\\\\ABC\"| rex field=example max_match=3\".*\\\\\\(?<extract>.*)\""}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalexample=\"xyz\\\\ABC\"| rex field=example max_match=3\".*\\x5c(?<extract>.*)\""}], "tables": [{"headers": ["time", "example", "extract"], "rows": [["2023-09-20 17:20:59", "xyz\\ABC", "ABC"]]}], "chunk_index": 1, "total_chunks": 3, "metadata": {"title": "SPL and regular expressions", "section_heading": "Backslash characters in regular expressions", "section_id": "id_76a4151b_c86b_4d8e_a82c_7ebdc0c61e29--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/search-manual/10.2/expressions-and-predicates/spl-and-regular-expressions", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > Search Manual > Expressions and Predicates", "manual": "search-manual", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:22:01.407440+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

{"id": "b235fa99ed396ed5", "content": "There are several situations in which you should avoid using wildcard characters. Avoid using wildcards in the middle of a string Certain searches with wildcard characters in the middle of a word or string might cause inconsistent results. This is especially true if the string contains punctuation, such as an underscore _ or dash - character. If your search displays a warning message indicating that a term contains a wildcard with punctuation in the middle of a word or string, rewrite your search. For example, if your search contains the following string: Modify your search to use the following string instead: A search that uses a wildcard in the middle of the term returns inconsistent results because of the way in which data that contains punctuation is indexed and searched. For example, suppose you have the following list of product IDs. Say you create a search that looks for all of the product IDs that begin with the letter S and end in G01, like this: Your search will fail because of the way that events are indexed. When the events with the product IDs are indexed, the product IDs are broken up into segments. For example, the product ID SC-MG-G01 has these segments: SC , MG , G01. There is no segment that starts with an S and ends with G01, which is what the search productID=S*G01 specifies. Because there are no segments that match your search, no results are found. The solution to this problem? If the number of product IDs is small, specify the exact product IDs in your search rather than using a wildcard. For example: If the number of product IDs is large, use a lookup instead of a wildcard. To learn more about how punctuation can impact using wildcards, see Event segmentation and searching. Avoid using wildcards to match punctuation Punctuation are characters that are not numbers or letters. If you want to match part of a string that includes punctuation, specify each string with the punctuation that you are searching for. For example, you have the following values in the uri_path field in your events. You want to match every uri_path that starts with /cart. The problem is that the paths contain a forward slash ( / ) character and period (. ) character. Instead of specifying a wildcard character for the punctuation such as /cart* , specify the punctuation directly in your search criteria. For example, Avoid using wildcards as prefixes When you use a wildcard character at the beginning of a string, the search must look at every string to determine if the end of the string matches what you specify after the asterisk. Using a prefix wildcard is almost like using a wildcard by itself. Prefix wildcards might cause performance issues.

Transforming searches When a transforming search is run without the built-in optimization, all of the event types and tags are uploaded from the configuration system to the search processor. This upload happens whether the search requires the event types and tags or not. The search processing attempts to apply the event types and tags to each event. For example, consider the following search: This search needs only the tag foo. But without the optimization, all of the event types and tags are uploaded. The built-in optimization solves this problem by analyzing the search and only uploading the event types and tags that are required. If no event types or tags are needed, none are uploaded which improves search performance. For transforming searches, this optimization is controlled by several settings in the limits.conf file, under the [search_optimization::required_field_values] stanza. These settings are turned on by default. There is no need to change these settings, unless you need to troubleshoot an issue. Data model acceleration searches Another problem that can be solved by the event type and tags optimization is specifically targeted at data model acceleration. With a configuration setting in the datamodels.conf file, you can specify a list of tags that you want to use with the data model acceleration searches. You specify the list under the [dm.name] stanza with the tags_whitelist setting.

Searches fall into two types, that are based on the goal you want to accomplish.

Searches that retrieve events Raw event searches retrieve events from a Splunk index without any additional processing of the events that are retrieved. When retrieving events from the index, be specific about the events that you want to retrieve. You can do this with keywords and field-value pairs that are unique to the events. If the events you want to retrieve occur frequently in the dataset, the search is called a dense search. If the events you want to retrieve are rare in the dataset, the search is called a sparse search. Sparse searches that run against large volumes of data take longer than dense searches against the same data set. See Use fields to retrieve events. Searches that generate reports Report-generating searches, or transforming searches, perform additional processing on events after the events are retrieved from an index. This processing can include filtering, transforming, and other operations using one or more statistical functions against the set of results.

{"id": "e432fc9ee0029477", "content": "Some commands process events in a stream. There is one event in and one, or no, event out. These are referred to as streaming commands. Examples of streaming commands are where , eval , lookup , and search. Other commands require all of the events from all of the indexers before the command can finish. These are referred to as non-streaming commands. Examples of non-streaming commands are stats , sort , dedup , top , and append. Non-streaming commands can run only when all of the data is available. To process non-streaming commands, all of the search results from the indexers are sent to the search head. When this happens, all further processing must be performed by the search head, rather than in parallel on the indexers. Parallel processing example Non-streaming commands that are early in your search reduce parallel processing. For example, the following image shows a search that a user has run. The search starts with the search command, which is implied as the first command in the Search bar. The search continues with the lookup , where , and eval commands. The search then contains a sort , based on the Name field, followed by another where command. The search is sent to the search head and distributed to the indexers to process as much of the search as possible on the indexers. For the events that are on each indexer, the indexer processes the search until the indexer encounters a non-streaming command. In this example, the indexers process the search through the eval command. To perform the sort , all of the results must be sent to the search head for processing. However, the results that are on each indexer can be sorted by the indexer. This is referred to as a presort. In this example the sort is on the Name field. The following image shows that the first indexer returns the names Alex and Maria. The second indexer returns the name Wei. The third indexer returns the names Claudia, David, and Eduardo. To return the full list of results sorted by name, all of the events that match the search criteria must be sent to the search head. When all of the results are on the search head, the rest of the search must be processed on the search head. In this example the sort and any remaining commands are processed on the search head. The following image shows that each indexer has presorted the results, based on the Name field. The results are sent to the search head, and are appended together. The search head then sorts the entire list into the correct order. The search head processes the remaining commands in the search to produce the final results. In this example, that includes the second where command. The final results are returned to the user. When part or all of a search is run on the indexers, the search processes in parallel and search performance is much quicker.

Performing statistics with a BY clause on a set of field values that have a high cardinality, lots of uncommon or unique values, requires a lot of memory. One possible remedy is to decrease the value for the chunk_size setting used with the tstats command. Additionally, reducing the number of distinct values that the BY clause must process can also be beneficial. Restrict searches to the specific index If you rarely search across more than one type of data at a time, partition your different types of data into separate indexes. Then restrict your searches to the specific index. For example, store Web access data in one index and firewall data in another.

For more information about indexed fields and default fields, see About fields in the Knowledge Manager Manual. Use indexed and default fields Use indexed and default fields whenever you can to help search or filter your data efficiently. At index time, Splunk software extracts a set of default fields that are common to each event. These fields include host , source , and sourcetype. Use these fields to filter your data as early as possible in the search so that processing is done on a minimum amount of data. For example, if you're building a report on web access errors, search for those specific errors before the reporting command: Specify indexed fields with <field>::<value> You can also run efficient searches for fields that have been indexed from structured data such as CSV files and JSON data sources. When you do this, replace the equal sign with double colons, like this: <field>::<value>.

{"id": "713bd353f85c2941", "content": "SQL is designed to search relational database tables which are comprised of columns. SPL is designed to search events, which are comprised of fields. In SQL, you often see examples that use \"mytable\" and \"mycolumn\". In SPL, you will see examples that refer to \"fields\". In these examples, the \"source\" field is used as a proxy for \"table\". In Splunk software, \"source\" is the name of the file, stream, or other input from which a particular piece of data originates, for example /var/log/messages or UDP:514. Note: When translating from any language to another, often the translation is longer because of idioms in the original language. Some of the Splunk search examples shown below could be more concise and more efficient, but for parallelism and clarity, the SPL table and field names are kept the same as the SQL example. SPL searches rarely need the FIELDS command to filter out columns because the user interface provides a more convenient method for filtering. The FIELDS command is used in the SPL examples for parallelism. With SPL, you never have to use the AND operator in Boolean searches, because AND is implied between terms. However when you use the AND or OR operators, they must be specified in uppercase. SPL commands do not need to be specified in uppercase. In the these SPL examples, the commands are specified in uppercase for easier identification and clarity. Although some SPL commands loosely correspond to specific SQL commands as shown in the following table, your SPL searches might not produce the desired results if you \"think in SQL.\" For this reason, avoid directly translating from SQL to SPL when you design your searches.

Usage You can use this function with the eval and where commands, and as part of evaluation expressions with other commands. Because the elements of JSON arrays can have many data types (such as string, numeric, Boolean, and null), the mv_to_json_array function lets you specify how it should map the contents of multivalue fields into JSON arrays.

{"id": "23d8a4d662b68b8c", "content": "This function appends values to the ends of indicated arrays within a JSON document. This function provides a JSON eval function equivalent to the multivalue mvappend function. Usage The json_append function always has at least three function inputs: <json> (the name of a valid JSON document such as a JSON object), and at least one <path> and <value> pair. If <json> does not reference a valid JSON document, such as a JSON object, the function outputs nothing. The json_append function evaluates <path_value_pairs> from left to right. When a path-value pair is evaluated, the function updates the <json> document. The function then evaluates the next path-value pair against the updated document. You can use this function with the eval and where commands, and as part of evaluation expressions with other commands. Use <path> to designate a JSON document value Each <path> designates an array or value within the <json> document. The json_append function adds the corresponding <value> to the end of the value designated by the <path>. The following table explains what json_append does depending on what the <path> specifies. The json_append function ignores path-value pairs for which the <path> does not identify any valid value in the JSON document. Append arrays as single elements When the new <value> is an array, json_append appends the array as a single element. For example, if a json_array <path> leads to the array [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] and its <value> is the array [\"d\", \"e\", \"f\"] , the result is [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", [\"d\", \"e\", \"f\"]]. Appending arrays as single elements separates json_append from json_extend , a similar function that flattens arrays and objects into separate elements as it appends them. When json_extend takes the example in the preceding paragraph, it returns [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\", \"e\", \"f\"]. Examples The following examples show how you can use json_append to append values to arrays within a JSON document. 1. Add a string to an array Say you have an object named ponies that contains an array named ponylist : [\"Minty\", \"Rarity\", \"Buttercup\"]. This is the search you would run to append \"Fluttershy\" to ponylist. The output of that eval statement is {\"ponylist\": [\"Minty\", \"Rarity\", \"Buttercup\", \"Fluttershy\"]}. 2. Append a string to a nested object This example has a <path> with the value Fluttershy.ponySkills. Fluttershy.ponySkills references an array of an object that is nested within ponyDetails , the source object. The query uses json_append to add a string to the nested object array.

Usage You can use this function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions. Using isnum in searches with NaN In eval functions, fields can be either a string or a number. Working with NaN (Not a Number) values in the Splunk platform can be challenging because Splunk fields contain values that can be processed as either strings or numeric values based on their context. This can create confusion between a numeric NaN value, and the string representation of that value, \"NaN\". For example, depending on the kind of value that is needed to satisfy the current calculation, a NaN can be a numeric NaN , or a string \"NaN\" that can be interpreted as a numeric value or treated as a string. If your data contains \"NaN\" , you should proceed with caution when using searches that require NaN handling in SPL because NaN values can behave in unexpected ways. If you're using \"NaN\" in your searches with the isnum command, it's important to distinguish between a literal string \"NaN\" and a field containing the value \"NaN\". When a field contains a \"NaN\" string, the \"NaN\" behaves as both a string and a number. However, when a \"NaN\" value is present as a literal string in an evaluator expression, it is considered a string, not a number. For example, because \"NaN\" is just a collection of characters, it is considered a string and returns false in a search like isnum(\"NaN\"). However, if the same value is stored as \"NaN\" in a field, it is parsed as a numeric type. For example, say you run the following search. Your results look like this. Notice that literalNanIsNumeric is false because the isnum command interprets \"NaN\" as a string, not a number. It can be difficult to determine whether a value stored in a numeric field is a NaN or a literal value. A reliable test for NaN in the Splunk platform to confirm that a value is a real numeric NaN is to include the following search string in your search: For example, if the value you're testing is \"NaN\" , the search returns isnan is True , like the following search: See Numeric calculations. Basic examples The following example uses the isnum function with the if function. A field, \"n\", is added to each result with a value of \"yes\" or \"no\", depending on the result of the isnum function.

Basic example The following example returns descriptions for the corresponding http status code. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look like this: For an example of how to display a default value when that status does not match one of the values specified, see the True function. Extended example This example shows you how to use the case function in two different ways, to create categories and to create a custom sort order. You want classify earthquakes based on depth. Shallow-focus earthquakes occur at depths less than 70 km. Mid-focus earthquakes occur at depths between 70 and 300 km. Deep-focus earthquakes occur at depths greater than 300 km. We'll use Low, Mid, and Deep for the category names. The eval command is used to create a field called Description , which takes the value of \"Low\", \"Mid\", or \"Deep\" based on the Depth of the earthquake. The case() function is used to specify which ranges of the depth fits each description. For example, if the depth is less than 70 km, the earthquake is characterized as a shallow-focus quake; and the resulting Description is Low. The search also pipes the results of the eval command into the stats command to count the number of earthquakes and display the minimum and maximum magnitudes for each Description. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look like this: You can sort the results in the Description column by clicking the sort icon in Splunk Web. However in this example the order would be alphabetical returning results in Deep, Low, Mid or Mid, Low, Deep order.

{"id": "a3006b226cde72bd", "content": "Description This function returns TRUE when an IP address, <ip> , belongs to a particular CIDR subnet, <cidr>. Both <cidr> and <ip> are string arguments. If you specify a literal string value, instead of a field name, that value must be enclosed in double quotation marks. The cidrmatch function supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and subnets that use CIDR notation. Usage You can use this function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions. Basic examples The following example uses the cidrmatch and if functions to set a field, isLocal , to \"local\" if the field ip matches the subnet. If the ip field does not match the subnet, the isLocal field is set to \"not local\". The following example uses the cidrmatch function as a filter to remove events that do not match the ip address: Extended examples for IPv4 addresses You can use the cidrmatch function to identify CIDR IP addresses by subnet. The following example uses cidrmatch with the eval command to compare an IPv4 address with a subnet that uses CIDR notation to determine whether the IP address is a member of the subnet. If there is a match, the search returns true in a new field called result. The IP address is not in the subnet, so search displays false in the result field. The search results look something like this. In the following example, cidrmatch evaluates the IPv4 address 192.0.2.56 to find out if it is in the subnet. This time, instead of using the eval command with the cidrmatch function, we're using the where command, which eliminates any IP addresses that aren't within the subnet. This search compares the CIDR IP address with the subnet and filters the search results by returning the IP address only if it is true. The IP address is located within the subnet, so it is displayed in the search results, which look like this. Note that you can get the same results when using the search command, as shown in this example. The results of the search look like this. Extended examples for IPv6 addresses The following example uses cidrmatch with the eval command to compare an IPv6 address with a subnet that uses CIDR notation to determine whether the IP address is a member of the subnet. If there is a match, search returns true in a new field called result. The IP address is located within the subnet, so search displays true in the result field. The search results look something like this. The following example is another way to use cidrmatch to identify which IP addresses are in a subnet. This time, instead of using the eval command with the cidrmatch function, we're using the where command.

{"id": "5e151a4a3a7647fc", "content": "Description This function performs a CSV lookup. It returns the output field or fields in the form of a JSON object. Note: The lookup() function is available only to Splunk Enterprise users. Syntax lookup(\"<lookup_table>\", json_object(\"<input_field>\", <match_field>,...), json_array(\"<output_field>\",...)) Usage You can use the lookup() function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions. The lookup() function takes an <input_field> from a CSV <lookup_table> , finds events in the search result that have the <match_field> , and then identifies other field-value pairs from from the CSV table that correspond to the input_field and adds them to the matched events in the form of a JSON object. The lookup() requires a <lookup_table>. You can provide this either a CSV lookup file or CSV lookup definition, enclosed within quotation marks. To provide a file, give the full filename of a CSV lookup file that is stored in the global lookups directory ( $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/lookups/ ) or in a lookup directory that matches your current app context, such as $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/users/<user>/<app>/lookups/. If the first quoted string does not end in \".csv\", the eval processor assumes it is the name of a CSV lookup definition. Specified CSV lookup definitions must be shared globally. CSV lookup definitions cannot be private or shared to a specific app. Note: Specify a lookup definition if you want the various settings associated with the definition to apply, such as limits on matches, case-sensitive match options, and so on. A lookup() function can use multiple <input_field> / <match_field> pairs to identify events, and multiple <output_field> values can be applied to those events. Here is an example of valid lookup() syntax with multiple inputs, matches, and outputs. For more information about uploading CSV lookup files and creating CSV lookup definitions, see Define a CSV lookup in Splunk Web in the Knowledge Manager Manual. The lookup() function uses two JSON functions for eval : json_object and json_array. JSON functions allow the eval processor to efficiently group things together. For more information, see JSON functions in the Search Reference. Examples These examples show different ways to use the lookup() function. 1. Simple example that returns a JSON object with an array This simple makeresults example returns an array that illustrates what status_description values are paired in the http_status.csv lookup table with a status_type of Successful. This search returns: output={\"status_description\":[\"OK\",\"Created\",\"Accepted\",\"Non-Authoritative Information\",\"No Content\",\"Reset Content\",\"Partial Content\"]} 2. Example of a search with multiple input and match field pairs This search uses multiple input and match field pairs to show that an event with type=\"Successful\" and status=\"200\" matches a status_description of OK in the http_status.csv lookup table. This search returns: output={\"status_description\":\"OK\"} 3. Get counts of HTTP status description and type pairs This example matches values of a status field in a http_status.csv lookup file with values of status fields in the returned events. It then generates JSON objects as values of a status_details field, with the corresponding status_description and status_type field-value pairs, and adds them to the events. Finally, it provides counts of the JSON objects, broken out by object. Here is an example of a JSON object returned by this search: status_details=JSON:{\"status_description\":\"Created\",\"status_type\":\"Successful\"} 4. Get counts of the HTTP status description values that have been applied to your events by a HTTP status eval lookup This example shows how you can nest a lookup function inside another eval function. In this case it is the json_extract JSON function. This extracts status_description field-value pairs from the json_array objects and applies them to corresponding events. The search then returns a count of events with status_description fields, broken out by status_description value. Here is an example of an extracted status_description value returned by this search.

{"id": "152a321dfb0eea06", "content": "The eval command is a distributable streaming command. See Command types. General You must specify a field name for the results that are returned from your eval command expression. You can specify a name for a new field or for an existing field. CAUTION: If the field name that you specify matches an existing field name, the values in the existing field are replaced by the results of the eval expression. Numbers and strings can be assigned to fields, while booleans cannot be assigned. However you can convert booleans and nulls to strings using the tostring() function, which can be assigned to fields. If you are using a search as an argument to the eval command and functions, you cannot use a saved search name; you must pass a literal search string or a field that contains a literal search string (like the 'search' field extracted from index=_audit events). Numeric calculations During calculations, numbers are treated as double-precision floating-point numbers, subject to all the usual behaviors of floating point numbers. If the calculation results in the floating-point special value NaN (Not a Number), it is represented as \"nan\" in your results. The special values for positive and negative infinity are represented in your results as \"inf\" and \"-inf\" respectively. Division by zero results in a null field. See the isnum and the isstr functions in Informational functions. Rounding Results are rounded to a precision appropriate to the precision of the input results. The precision of the results can be no greater than the precision of the least-precise input. For example, the following search has different precision for 0.2 in each of the calculations based on the number of zeros following the number 2: The results look like this: If you want to return an arbitrary number of digits of precision, use the exact function, as shown in the last calculation in the search. See the exact evaluation function. Long numbers There are situations where the results of a calculation contain more digits than can be represented by a floating- point number. In those situations precision might be lost on the least significant digits. The limit to precision is 17 significant digits, or -2 53 +1 to 2 53 -1. Significant digits If a result returns a long number with more digits than you want to use, you can specify the number of digits to return using the sigfig function. See Example 2 under the basic examples for the sigfig(X) function. Supported functions You can use a wide range of functions with the eval command. For general information about using functions, see Evaluation functions. For a list of functions by category, see Function list by category. For an alphabetical list of functions, see Alphabetical list of functions. Operators The following table lists the basic operations you can perform with the eval command. For these evaluations to work, the values need to be valid for the type of operation. For example, with the exception of addition, arithmetic operations might not produce valid results if the values are not numerical. When concatenating values, Splunk software reads the values as strings, regardless of the value. Operators that produce numbers The plus ( + ) operator accepts two numbers for addition, or two strings for concatenation. The subtraction ( - ), multiplication ( * ), division ( / ), and modulus ( % ) operators accept two numbers. Operators that produce strings The period (. ) operator concatenates both strings and number. Numbers are concatenated in their string represented form. Operators that produce booleans The AND, OR, and XOR operators accept two Boolean values. The < , > , <= , >= , != , = , and == operators accept two numbers or two strings. In expressions, the single equal sign ( = ) is a synonym for the double equal sign ( == ). The LIKE operator accepts two strings. This is a pattern match similar to what is used in SQL. For example string LIKE pattern. The pattern operator supports literal text, a percent ( % ) character for a wildcard, and an underscore ( _ ) character for a single character match. For example, field LIKE \"a%b_\" matches any string starting with a , followed by anything, followed by b , followed by one character. The = and == operators In expressions, the single equal sign ( = ) and the double equal sign ( == ) are synonymous. Although you can use these operators interchangeably in your searches to make assignments or comparisons, keep the following conventions in mind when you create your searches: The = operator means either \"is equal to\" or \"is assigned to\", depending on the context. This operator is typically used to assign a value to a field. The == operator means \"is equal to\". This operator is typically used to compare 2 values. For example, in the following search, = is used to assign the description to the case expression, and == is used to indicate status is equal to specific error codes. Boolean expressions The order in which Boolean expressions are evaluated with the eval command is: Expressions within parentheses NOT clauses AND clauses OR clauses XOR clauses This evaluation order is different than the order used with the search command, which evaluates OR before AND clauses, and doesn't support XOR. See Boolean expressions with logical operators in the Splunk platform Search Manual. Field names To specify a field name with multiple words, you can either concatenate the words, or use single quotation marks when you specify the name. For example, to specify the field name Account ID you can specify AccountID or 'Account ID'. To specify a field name with special characters, such as a period, use single quotation marks. For example, to specify the field name Last.Name use 'Last.Name'. When assigning the value of a field to the value of another field, do not use leading spaces in the field name. However, you can use spaces at the end of the field name. For example, a search like this that assigns the same value to fields called first and second produces valid results, even though first has a trailing space: However, the following search does not produce valid results because first has a leading space: Dynamic field name creation You can use the value of one field as the name of another field by using curly braces ( { } ), which dynamically creates a field name on the left side of an eval expression. For example, if you have an event with the aName=counter and aValue=1234 fields, use | eval {aName}=aValue to return counter=1234. Searches that dynamically create field names generate errors and do not complete if there are unbounded recursive replacements. For example, the following search doesn't produce results because the right side of the eval expression generates bracketed field names that are recursive. In this case, {p} replaces the value of p in the fieldname, so v_{p} becomes v_{p} over and over again, in a recursive loop. The following search produces valid results because the value of one field is not recursively used as the name of another field. The search results look something like this: Calculated fields You can use eval statements to define calculated fields by defining the eval statement in props.conf. If you are using Splunk Cloud Platform, you can define calculated fields using Splunk Web, by choosing Settings > Fields > Calculated Fields. When you run a search, Splunk software evaluates the statements and creates fields in a manner similar to that of search time field extraction. Setting up calculated fields means that you no longer need to define the eval statement in a search string. Instead, you can search on the resulting calculated field directly. You can use calculated fields to move your commonly used eval statements out of your search string and into props.conf , where they will be processed behind the scenes at search time. With calculated fields, you can change the search from: to this search: In this example, the three eval statements that were in the search--that defined the accountname , from_user , and from_domain fields--are now computed behind the scenes when the search is run for any event that contains the extracted field mailfrom field. You can also search on those fields independently once they're set up as calculated fields in props.conf. You could search on from_domain=email.com , for example. For more information about calculated fields, see About calculated fields in the Knowledge Manager Manual.

Coalesce a field from two different source types, create a transaction of events This example shows how you might coalesce a field from two different source types and use that to create a transaction of events. sourcetype=A has a field called number , and sourcetype=B has the same information in a field called subscriberNumber. The eval command is used to add a common field, called phone , to each of the events whether they are from sourcetype=A or sourcetype=B. The value of phone is defined, using the coalesce() function, as the values of number and subscriberNumber. The coalesce() function takes the value of the first non-NULL field (that means, it exists in the event). Now, you're able to group events from either source type A or B if they share the same phone value. 2. Separate events into categories, count and display minimum and maximum values Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than 70 km are classified as shallow-focus earthquakes, while those with a focal-depth between 70 and 300 km are commonly termed mid-focus earthquakes. In subduction zones, deep-focus earthquakes may occur at much greater depths (ranging from 300 up to 700 kilometers). To classify recent earthquakes based on their depth, you use the following search. The eval command is used to create a field called Description , which takes the value of \"Shallow\", \"Mid\", or \"Deep\" based on the Depth of the earthquake. The case() function is used to specify which ranges of the depth fits each description. For example, if the depth is less than 70 km, the earthquake is characterized as a shallow-focus quake; and the resulting Description is Shallow. The search also pipes the results of the eval command into the stats command to count the number of earthquakes and display the minimum and maximum magnitudes for each Description. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: 3. Find IP addresses and categorize by network using eval functions cidrmatch and if In this search, you're finding IP addresses and classifying the network they belong to. This example uses the cidrmatch() function to compare the IP addresses in the clientip field to a subnet range. The search also uses the if() function, which says that if the value of clientip falls in the subnet range, then the network field value is local. Otherwise, network=other. The eval command does not do any special formatting to your results. The command creates a new field based on the eval expression you specify. In the fields sidebar, click on the network field. In the popup, next to Selected click Yes and close the popup. Now you can see, inline with your search results, which IP addresses are part of your local network and which are not. Your events list looks something like this: Another option for formatting your results is to pipe the results of eval to the table command to display only the fields of interest to you. Note: This example just illustrates how to use the cidrmatch function. If you want to classify your events and quickly search for those events, the better approach is to use event types. Read more about event types in the Knowledge manager manual. 4. Extract information from an event into a separate field, create a multivalue field Use the email address field to extract the name and domain. The eval command in this search contains multiple expressions, separated by commas. The split() function is used to break the mailfrom field into a multivalue field called accountname. The first value of accountname is everything before the \"@\" symbol, and the second value is everything after. The mvindex() function is used to set from_user to the first value in accountname and to set from_domain to the second value in accountname. The results of the eval expressions are then piped into the table command. You can see the the original mailfrom values and the new from_user and from_domain values in the results table. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: Note: This example was written to demonstrate how to use an eval function to identify the individual values of a multivalue fields. Because this particular set of email data did not have any multivalue fields, the example creates a multivalue filed, accountname , from a single value field, mailfrom. 5. Categorize events using the match function This example classifies where an email came from based on the email address domain. The .com, .net, and .org addresses are considered local , while anything else is considered abroad. There are many domain names. Of course, domains that are not .com, .net, or .org are not necessarily from abroad. This is just an example. The eval command in this search contains multiple expressions, separated by commas. The first half of this search is similar to previous example. The split() function is used to break up the email address in the mailfrom field. The mvindex function defines the from_domain as the portion of the mailfrom field after the @ symbol. Then, the if() and match() functions are used. If the from_domain value ends with a .com, .net., or .org , the location field is assigned the value local. If from_domain does not match, location is assigned the value abroad. The eval results are then piped into the stats command to count the number of results for each location value. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: Note: This example merely illustrates using the match() function. If you want to classify your events and quickly search for those events, the better approach is to use event types. Read more about event types in the Knowledge manager manual. 6. Convert the duration of transactions into more readable string formats When you use the transaction command, as shown in the following search, it calculates the length of time for the transaction. A new field, called duration , is automatically added to the results. The duration is the time between the first and last events in the transaction. In the Interesting fields list, click on the duration field to see the top 10 values for duration. The values are displayed in seconds. Click Yes to add the field to the Selected fields list. You can use the eval command to reformat a numeric field into a more readable string format. The following search uses the tostring() function with the \"duration\" option to convert the values in the duration field into a string formatted as HH:MM:SS. The search defines a new field, durationstr , for the reformatted duration values. In the Interesting fields list, click on the durationstr field and select Yes to add the field to the Selected fields list. The values for the fields now appear in the set of fields below each transaction.

{"id": "02ef066422da5373", "content": "Description This function takes a nonnegative integer as an argument and inverts every bit in the binary representation of that number. This function also takes an optional second argument with a default value of 2 53 -1 that acts as a bitmask that is used in an AND operation with the result of the first operation. You can think of the bitmask as the value up to which you want to print the result. Both arguments must be in the range of 0 to 2 53 -1 or the operation returns null. Usage You might want to use an optional integer bitmask as the second argument in a bit_not function to limit the number of leading 1s in the result. The bitmask truncates the result by performing a silent bitwise AND on the result of a bitwise NOT operation. The number of bits specified as the bitmask indicates the number of bits you want to see in the results. For example, if the bitmask argument is \"1111\" , the first four bits of the binary results are displayed. Consider the following search, which specifies a four-bit bitmask: The results look something like this: The short_binary result is 110 instead of a long string of bits like the long_binary results. You might wonder why the result is only three bits, and not four bits, since you specified \"1111\" in the bitmask. The binary result is actually 0110 , but the leading 0 is not displayed. You can take a closer look at what is happening in the sequence of bitwise operations using the following table as a guide. First, the bitmask is set to the bitwise NOT of 0, by default.

{"id": "03b6081e790d3d8e", "content": "Description This logical left shift function takes two valid nonnegative integers as arguments and shifts the binary representation of the first integer over to the left by the specified shift offset amount.

All results are masked to stay below the 2 53 -1 limit in case of overflows. Usage The shift offset is an integer that specifies the number of times the given integer is shifted to the left. When the bits in a binary digit are shifted to the left, the most-significant bit on the left side is lost and a 0 bit is inserted on the right side of the value.

Shifting right drops the rightmost bit and prepends a 0 to the binary representation of the input. Both arguments must be in the range of 0 to 2 53 -1 or the operation returns null. All results are masked to stay below the 2 53 -1 limit in case of overflows. Usage The shift offset is an integer that specifies the number of times the given integer is shifted to the right. For example, the result of the following function is 2. This is because the binary representation of the decimal number 4 is 0100, which is 0010 when shifted left by 1. The decimal value of 0010 is 2. Like the bit_shift_left function, the bit_shift_right function supports only nonnegative integers in the range of 0 to 2 53 -1.

The results look something like this: 2. Compare the results of bit shift functions Consider the following search, which includes sequential logical left shift and logical right shift functions. The results look something like this: 3. Get the binary representation of a value from another function If you want to see your results in binary, you can use the tostring function to convert an argument to a binary string. See tostring(X,Y). The following search converts the result of the bit_shift_left(2,1) to its binary representation, which is 100. The results look something like this: 4. Apply a bitmask to limit the binary output Consider this search, which uses the bit_not function to invert the bits in the result. The results look something like this: The binary result in the string field has a lot of leading 1's that are in the way. To limit the output, add a bitmask that specifies that you want to see only three bits in the final result, like this: The results look something like this: The result is the three-bit binary string 110 instead of a lot of 1s and 0s. 5. Using values that are outside the range of supported values Look at what happens when you use a value as input in a function that falls outside of the range of supported values, which is 0 to 2 53 -1. In the following search, the input to the function is 2 53 -1, the max_supported_value , plus one. The results look something like this: The search returns only the value for max_supported_val and the value for the result field is not displayed. This is because result is outside of the supported range of values, so the function returns null. The function also returns null if you use negative values as input. 6. Update a binary string to set flags You can run the following search to set multiple flags using a variable called flags. The results look something like this: You can see that the first, fourth, and fifth bits in 11011 are set. 7. Check whether a specific flag in a binary string is set You can run the following search to check whether the third flag in a variable called flags is set. The results look something like this: You can see that the third bit in the flag 00010 is set to 0. 8. Determine the matching bits in two binary strings This search gives you the matching bits in two binary strings. Every bit that matches is displayed as 1 in the search results. The results look something like this: You can see that the matching bits in 10011 and 10001 are the first, third, fourth, and last bits. 9. Append a bit flag to a binary string The following search uses bit_shift_left and bit_or to add a bit flag of 1 to the binary string 10001. The results look something like this: You appended 10001 , so now the result is 100011. 10. Use nested bitwise operations You can nest multiple bitwise operations in a single search. For example, say you have a field called StreamId=0x12da3b7514f19ce7. If you want to perform StreamId >> 8 & 0xFFFFFFFF , which right-shifts the StreamID by 8 and then performs a bitwise AND operation with 0xFFFFFFFF, you can run the following search: The results look something like this:", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalAND_result = bit_and(4, 6), OR_result = bit_or(4, 6), XOR_result = bit_xor(4, 6)"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalLEFT_result = bit_shift_left(2,1), RIGHT_result = bit_shift_right(2,1)"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalLEFT_result = bit_shift_left(2,1) \n|evalstring = tostring(LEFT_result,\"binary\")"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalNOT_result = bit_not(9) \n|evalstring = tostring(NOT_result,\"binary\")"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalNOT_result = bit_not(9, tonumber(\"111\",2)) \n|evalstring = tostring(NOT_result,\"binary\")"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalmax_supported_val = pow(2, 53)-1 \n|evalresult = bit_and(max_supported_val + 1, 1)"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalflags =\"00010\", result = tonumber(flags, 2) \n|evalresult = bit_or(result, tonumber(\"11001\", 2)) \n|evalresult = tostring(result,\"binary\")"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalflags =\"00010\", result = tonumber(flags, 2) \n|evalresult = bit_and(result, 4) \n|evalresult =if(result==0,\"false\",\"true\")"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalbin_number1 =\"10011\", bin_number2 =\"10001\", number1 = tonumber(bin_number1, 2), number2 = tonumber(bin_number2, 2) \n|evalmatching_bits = bit_xor(number1, number2) \n|evalmatching_bits = bit_not(matching_bits, tonumber(\"11111\",2)) \n|evalmatching_bits = tostring(matching_bits,\"binary\")"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalflags =\"10001\", result = tonumber(flags, 2), flag_bool = 1 \n|evalresult = bit_shift_left(result, 1) \n|evalresult = bit_or(result, flag_bool) \n|evalresult = tostring(result,\"binary\")"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalstreamId = tonumber(\"0xa3b7514f19ce7\", 16), result = bit_and(bit_shift_right(streamId,8), tonumber(\"0xFFFFFFFF\",16))"}], "tables": [{"headers": ["_time", "AND_result", "OR_result", "XOR_result"], "rows": [["2022-09-02  13:44:21", "4", "6", "2"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "LEFT_result", "RIGHT_result"], "rows": [["2022-09-02  13:44:21", "4", "1"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "LEFT_result", "string"], "rows": [["2022-09-02  11:23:43", "4", "100"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "NOT_result", "string"], "rows": [["2022-09-02  09:52:12", "9007199254740982", "11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111110110"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "NOT_result", "string"], "rows": [["2022-09-02  09:52:12", "6", "110"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "max_supported_val"], "rows": [["2022-09-04  11:15:19", "9007199254740991"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "flags", "result"], "rows": [["2022-09-05  12:19:03", "00010", "11011"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "flags", "result"], "rows": [["2022-09-05  09:13:22", "00010", "0"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "bin_number1", "bin_number2", "matching_bits", "number1", "number2"], "rows": [["2022-09-05  10:15:26", "10011", "10001", "11101", "19", "17"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "flags", "flag_bool", "result"], "rows": [["2022-09-05  12:19:20", "10001", "1", "100011"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "result", "StreamId"], "rows": [["2022-09-05  11:21:02", "1964306844", "2880123815697639"]]}], "chunk_index": 6, "total_chunks": 7, "metadata": {"title": "Bitwise functions", "section_heading": "Examples", "section_id": "e0af4855_657c_482b_8e12_4304f6ee593c--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/evaluation-functions/bitwise-functions", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Evaluation Functions", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:27:34.359904+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

You can use this function to convert a string or multivalue to an array. The toarray function infers the data type of each element as it converts a string or multivalue into an array. Usage You can use this function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions. The value argument can be a string or multivalue, or the name of a field that contains a string or multivalue. If the value is a string, it must be a list of comma-separated values enclosed in square brackets ( [ ] ), or else the function returns null. For example, this string value is a valid JSON array: [\"buttercup\", \"fluttershy\", \"rarity\"]. The following table describes how the toarray function converts specific types of values in search results. The function returns null for all other values. Basic examples The following search returns an array called my_array with the value [1,2,3]. The following search returns an array called grocery_array with the value [\"carrots\",1,\"potatoes\",1.75]. The following search returns True , indicating that \"somefield\" isn't an array.

{"id": "bd87a81862a9e9a7", "content": "Description This function takes a UNIX time value as the first argument and renders the time as a string using the format specified. The UNIX time must be in seconds. Use the first 10 digits of a UNIX time to use the time in seconds. You can use time format variables with the strftime function. For a complete list and descriptions of the format options, see Date and time format variables. Usage If the time is in milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds you must convert the time into seconds. You can use the pow function to convert the number. To convert from milliseconds to seconds, divide the number by 1000 or 10^3. To convert from microseconds to seconds, divide the number by 10^6. To convert from nanoseconds to seconds, divide the number by 10^9. The following search uses the pow function to convert from nanoseconds to seconds: The results appear on the Statistics tab and look like this: In these results, the _time value is the date and time when the search was run. You can use this function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions. Basic examples The following example returns the hour and minute from the _time field. If the _time field value is 2022-08-10 11:48:23 , the value returned in the hour_min field is 11:48. The following example creates a new field called starttime in your search results.

Extended example The following example creates a single result using the makeresults command. For example: The _time field is stored in UNIX time, even though it displays in a human readable format. To convert the UNIX time to some other format, you use the strftime function with the date and time format variables. The variables must be in quotations marks. For example, to return the week of the year that an event occurred in, use the %V variable. The results show that August 14th occurred in week 33.

{"id": "04e4a866b7ee9471", "content": "Description This function takes a time represented by a string and parses the time into a UNIX timestamp format. You use date and time variables to specify the format that matches string. For a complete list and descriptions of the variables, see Date and time format variables. The strptime function doesn't work with timestamps that consist of only a month and year. The timestamps must include a day. For example, if string X is 2022-08-13 11:22:33 , the format Y must be %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S. The string X date must be January 1, 1971 or later. The strptime function takes any date from January 1, 1971 or later, and calculates the UNIX time, in seconds, from January 1, 1970 to the date you provide. Note: The _time field is in UNIX time. In Splunk Web, the _time field appears in a human readable format in the UI but is stored in UNIX time. If you attempt to use the strptime function on the _time field, no action is performed on the values in the field.

{"id": "21835fc51bb88662", "content": "Description This function takes one argument, a number, and rounds that number to the appropriate number of significant figures. Usage You can use this function with the eval , fieldformat , and where commands, and as part of eval expressions. The computation for sigfig is based on the type of calculation that generates the number. For multiplication and division, the result should have the minimum number of significant figures of all of the operands. For addition and subtraction, the result should have the same number of decimal places as the least precise number of all of the operands. For example, the numbers 123.0 and 4.567 contain different precision with the decimal places. The first number is less precise because it has 1 decimal place. The second number is more precise because it has 3 decimal places. If the calculation is 123.0 + 4.567 = 127.567, then the sigfig function returns the fewest number of decimal places. In this example only one decimal place is returned. Because the numbers to the right of the last significant figure are greater than 5, the result returned is 127.6 Basic examples Example 1 : The following example shows how the sigfig function works. The calculation 1.00*1111 returns the value n=1111 , but the following search using the sigfig function returns n=1110. In this example, 1.00 has 3 significant figures and 1111 has 4 significant figures. In this example, the minimum number of significant figures for all operands is 3. Using the sigfig function, the final result is rounded to 3 digits, returning n=1110 and not 1111. Example 2 : There are situations where the results of a calculation can return a different accuracy to the very far right of the decimal point. For example, the following search calculates the average of 100 values: The result of this calculation is: When the count is changed to 10000, the results are different: The result of this calculation is: This occurs because numbers are treated as double-precision floating-point numbers. To mitigate this issue, you can use the sigfig function to specify the number of significant figures you want returned. However, first you need to make a change to the stats command portion of the search. You need to change the name of the field avg(test) to remove the parenthesis. For example stats avg(test) AS test. The sigfig function expects either a number or a field name for X. The sigfig function cannot accept a field name that looks like another function, in this case avg. To specify the number of decimal places you want returned, you multiply the field name by 1 and use zeros to specify the number of decimal places. If you want 4 decimal places returned, you would multiply the field name by 1.0000. To return 2 decimal places, multiply by 1.00, as shown in the following example: The result of this calculation is:", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "... |evaln=sigfig(1.00*1111)"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults count=100 |evaltest=3.99 | stats avg(test)"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults count=10000 |evaltest=3.99 | stats avg(test)"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults count=10000 |evaltest=3.99 | stats avg(test) AStest|evalnew_test=sigfig(test*1.00)"}], "tables": [{"headers": ["avg(test)"], "rows": [["3.9900000000000055"]]}, {"headers": ["avg(test)"], "rows": [["3.990000000000215"]]}, {"headers": ["test"], "rows": [["3.99"]]}], "chunk_index": 10, "total_chunks": 13, "metadata": {"title": "Mathematical functions", "section_heading": "sigfig(<num>)", "section_id": "id_1ccffbba_b59f_442a_9517_1dd92136457b--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/evaluation-functions/mathematical-functions", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Evaluation Functions", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:28:57.212208+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

Example 2 : The following example calculates the sum of three numbers and returns c=6. However, the following example returns an error because one of the arguments in the function is a string. To use a quoted string as a number within the function, you must convert the number to an integer, as shown in the following example that returns c=6. Example 3 : In this example, a field with a value that is a string results in a field called a with value 1, and a field called c with value 6, Example 4 : When an argument is a field, the eval command retrieves the value and attempts to treat it as a number, even if it is a string. The following example creates a field called a with value somedata, and a field called c with value 5.

{"id": "59eded361c21edf9", "content": "The stats command is a transforming command. See Command types. Eval expressions with statistical functions When you use the stats command, you must specify either a statistical function or a sparkline function. When you use a statistical function, you can use an eval expression as part of the statistical function. For example: Statistical functions that are not applied to specific fields With the exception of the count function, when you pair the stats command with functions that are not applied to specific fields or eval expressions that resolve into fields, the search head processes it as if it were applied to a wildcard for all fields. In other words, when you have | stats avg in a search, it returns results for | stats avg(*). This \"implicit wildcard\" syntax is officially deprecated, however. Make the wildcard explicit. Write | stats <function>(*) when you want a function to apply to all possible fields. Numeric calculations During calculations, numbers are treated as double-precision floating-point numbers, subject to all the usual behaviors of floating point numbers. If the calculation results in the floating-point special value NaN, it is represented as \"nan\" in your results. The special values for positive and negative infinity are represented in your results as \"inf\" and \"-inf\" respectively. Division by zero results in a null field. There are situations where the results of a calculation contain more digits than can be represented by a floating- point number. In those situations precision might be lost on the least significant digits. For an example of how to correct this, see Example 2 of the basic examples for the sigfig(X) function. Ensure correct search behavior when time fields are missing from input data Ideally, when you run a stats search that aggregates results on a time function such as latest() , latest_time() , or rate() , the search should not return results when _time or _origtime fields are missing from the input data. However, searches that fit this description return results by default, which means that those results might be incorrect or random. Correct this behavior by changing the check_for_invalid_time setting in limits.conf file. Splunk Cloud Platform To change the check_for_invalid_time setting, request help from Splunk Support. If you have a support contract, file a new case using the Splunk Support Portal at Support and Services. Otherwise, contact Splunk Customer Support. Splunk Enterprise To change the check_for_invalid_time setting, follow these steps. Prerequisites Only users with file system access, such as system administrators, can change the check_for_invalid_time setting in the limits.conf configuration file. Review the steps in How to edit a configuration file in the Splunk Enterprise Admin Manual. You can have configuration files with the same name in your default, local, and app directories. Read Where you can place (or find) your modified configuration files in the Splunk Enterprise Admin Manual. CAUTION: Never change or copy the configuration files in the default directory. The files in the default directory must remain intact and in their original location. Make changes to the files in the local directory. Steps Open or create a local limits.conf file at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local. Under the [stats] stanza, set check_for_invalid_time to true. When you set check_for_invalid_time=true , the stats search processor does not return results for searches on time functions when the input data does not include the _time or _origtime fields. Functions and memory usage Some functions are inherently more expensive, from a memory standpoint, than other functions. For example, the distinct_count function requires far more memory than the count function. The values and list functions also can consume a lot of memory. If you are using the distinct_count function without a split-by field or with a low-cardinality split-by by field, consider replacing the distinct_count function with the the estdc function (estimated distinct count). The estdc function might result in significantly lower memory usage and run times. Memory and stats search performance A pair of limits.conf settings strike a balance between the performance of stats searches and the amount of memory they use during the search process, in RAM and on disk. If your stats searches are consistently slow to complete you can adjust these settings to improve their performance, but at the cost of increased search-time memory usage, which can lead to search failures. If you use Splunk Cloud Platform, you need to file a Support ticket to change these settings. For more information, see Memory and stats search performance in the Search Manual. Event order functions Using the first and last functions when searching based on time does not produce accurate results. To locate the first value based on time order, use the earliest function, instead of the first function. To locate the last value based on time order, use the latest function, instead of the last function. For example, consider the following search. Replace the first and last functions when you use the stats and eventstats commands for ordering events based on time. The following search shows the function changes. Wildcards in BY clauses The stats command does not support wildcard characters in field values in BY clauses. For example, you cannot specify | stats count BY source*.

Compare the difference between using the stats and chart commands This search uses the stats command to count the number of events for a combination of HTTP status code values and host: The BY clause returns one row for each distinct value in the BY clause fields. In this search, because two fields are specified in the BY clause, every unique combination of status and host is listed on separate row. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: If you click the Visualization tab, the status field forms the X-axis and the host and count fields form the data series. The problem with this chart is that the host values (www1, www2, www3) are strings and cannot be measured in a chart. Substitute the chart command for the stats command in the search. With the chart command, the two fields specified after the BY clause change the appearance of the results on the Statistics tab. The BY clause also makes the results suitable for displaying the results in a chart visualization. The first field you specify is referred to as the <row-split> field. In the table, the values in this field become the labels for each row. In the chart, this field forms the X-axis. The second field you specify is referred to as the <column-split> field. In the table, the values in this field are used as headings for each column. In the chart, this field forms the data series. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: If you click the Visualization tab, the status field forms the X-axis, the values in the host field form the data series, and the Y-axis shows the count. 2. Use eval expressions to count the different types of requests against each Web server Run the following search to use the stats command to determine the number of different page requests, GET and POST, that occurred for each Web server. This example uses eval expressions to specify the different field values for the stats command to count. The first clause uses the count() function to count the Web access events that contain the method field value GET. Then, using the AS keyword, the field that represents these results is renamed GET. The second clause does the same for POST events. The counts of both types of events are then separated by the web server, using the BY clause with the host field. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: Note: You can substitute the chart command for the stats command in this search. You can then click the Visualization tab to see a chart of the results. 3. Calculate a wide range of statistics by a specific field Count the number of earthquakes that occurred for each magnitude range Run the following search to calculate the number of earthquakes that occurred in each magnitude range. This data set is comprised of events over a 30-day period. This search uses span=1 to define each of the ranges for the magnitude field, mag. The rename command is then used to rename the field to \"Magnitude Range\". The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: Click the Visualization tab to see the result in a chart. Calculate aggregate statistics for the magnitudes of earthquakes in an area Search for earthquakes in and around California. Calculate the number of earthquakes that were recorded. Use statistical functions to calculate the minimum, maximum, range (the difference between the min and max), and average magnitudes of the recent earthquakes. List the values by magnitude type. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: Find the mean, standard deviation, and variance of the magnitudes of the recent quakes Search for earthquakes in and around California. Calculate the number of earthquakes that were recorded. Use statistical functions to calculate the mean, standard deviation, and variance of the magnitudes for recent earthquakes. List the values by magnitude type. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: The mean values should be exactly the same as the values calculated using avg(). 4. In a table display items sold by ID, type, and name and calculate the revenue for each product Create a table that displays the items sold at the Buttercup Games online store by their ID, type, and name. Also, calculate the revenue for each product. This example uses the values() function to display the corresponding categoryId and productName values for each productId. Then, it uses the sum() function to calculate a running total of the values of the price field. Also, this example renames the various fields, for better display. For the stats functions, the renames are done inline with an \"AS\" clause. The rename command is used to change the name of the product_id field, since the syntax does not let you rename a split-by field. Finally, the results are piped into an eval expression to reformat the Revenue field values so that they read as currency, with a dollar sign and commas. This returns the following table of results: 5. Determine how much email comes from each domain Find out how much of the email in your organization comes from .com, .net, .org or other top level domains. The eval command in this search contains two expressions, separated by a comma. The first part of this search uses the eval command to break up the email address in the mailfrom field. The from_domain is defined as the portion of the mailfrom field after the @ symbol. The split() function is used to break the mailfrom field into a multivalue field called accountname. The first value of accountname is everything before the \"@\" symbol, and the second value is everything after. The mvindex() function is used to set from_domain to the second value in the multivalue field accountname. The results are then piped into the stats command. The count() function is used to count the results of the eval expression. The eval uses the match() function to compare the from_domain to a regular expression that looks for the different suffixes in the domain. If the value of from_domain matches the regular expression, the count is updated for each suffix, .com , .net , and .org. Other domain suffixes are counted as other. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: 6. Search Web access logs for the total number of hits from the top 10 referring domains This example searches the web access logs and return the total number of hits from the top 10 referring domains. This search uses the top command to find the ten most common referer domains, which are values of the referer field. Some events might use referer_domain instead of referer. The top command returns a count and percent value for each referer. You can then use the stats command to calculate a total for the top 10 referrer accesses. The sum() function adds the values in the count to produce the total number of times the top 10 referrers accessed the web site.", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_* | stats count BY status, host"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_* | chart count BY status, host"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_* | stats count(eval(method=\"GET\")) AS GET, count(eval(method=\"POST\")) AS POST BY host"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "source=all_month.csv | chart count AS\"Number of Earthquakes\"BY mag span=1 | rename mag AS\"Magnitude Range\""}, {"language": "spl", "code": "source=all_month.csv place=*California* | stats count, max(mag), min(mag), range(mag), avg(mag) BY magType"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "source=usgs place=*California* | stats count mean(mag), stdev(mag), var(mag) BY magType"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_* status=200 action=purchase \n| stats values(categoryId) AS Type, values(productName) AS\"Product Name\", sum(price) \n  AS\"Revenue\"by productId \n| rename productId AS\"Product ID\"|evalRevenue=\"$ \".tostring(Revenue,\"commas\")"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=\"cisco:esa\"mailfrom=* \n|evalaccountname=split(mailfrom,\"@\"), from_domain=mvindex(accountname,-1) \n| stats count(eval(match(from_domain,\"[^\\n\\r\\s]+\\.com\"))) AS\".com\",\n  count(eval(match(from_domain,\"[^\\n\\r\\s]+\\.net\"))) AS\".net\", \n  count(eval(match(from_domain,\"[^\\n\\r\\s]+\\.org\"))) AS\".org\", \n  count(eval(NOT match(from_domain,\"[^\\n\\r\\s]+\\.(com|net|org)\"))) AS\"other\""}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_* | toplimit=10 referer"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_* | toplimit=10 referer | stats sum(count) AS total"}], "tables": [{"headers": [], "rows": [["This example uses the sample data from the Search Tutorial but should work with any format of Apache web access log.

{"id": "e45c9eaef01d76f6", "content": "The eventstats command is a dataset processing command. See Command types. The eventstats search processor uses a limits.conf file setting named max_mem_usage_mb to limit how much memory the eventstats command can use to keep track of information. When the limit is reached, the eventstats command processor stops adding the requested fields to the search results. Do not set max_mem_usage_mb=0 as this removes the bounds to the amount of memory the eventstats command processor can use. This can lead to search failures. Splunk Cloud Platform To change the max_mem_usage_mb setting, request help from Splunk Support. If you have a support contract, file a new case using the Splunk Support Portal at Support and Services. Otherwise, contact Splunk Customer Support. Splunk Enterprise To change the max_mem_usage_mb setting, follow these steps. Prerequisites Have the permissions to change the max_mem_usage_mb setting. Only users with file system access, such as system administrators, can increase the max_mem_usage_mb setting using configuration files. Know how to edit configuration files. Review the steps in How to edit a configuration file in the Splunk Enterprise Admin Manual. Decide which directory to store configuration file changes in. There can be configuration files with the same name in your default, local, and app directories. See Where you can place (or find) your modified configuration files in the Splunk Enterprise Admin Manual. CAUTION: Never change or copy the configuration files in the default directory. The files in the default directory must remain intact and in their original location. Make changes to the files in the local directory. Steps Open or create a local limits.conf file at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local. Under the [default] stanza, look for the max_mem_usage_mb setting. Under Note , read the information about the eventstats command and how the max_mem_usage_mb and the maxresultrows settings are used to determine the maximum number of results to return. Change the value for the max_mem_usage_mb setting and if necessary the maxresultrows setting. Differences between eventstats and stats The eventstats command is similar to the stats command. You can use both commands to generate aggregations like average, sum, and maximum. The differences between these commands are described in the following table: How eventstats generates aggregations The eventstats command looks for events that contain the field that you want to use to generate the aggregation. The command creates a new field in every event and places the aggregation in that field. The aggregation is added to every event, even events that were not used to generate the aggregation. For example, you have 5 events and 3 of the events have the field you want to aggregate on. the eventstats command generates the aggregation based on the data in the 3 events. A new field is added to every event and the aggregation is added to that field in every event. Statistical functions that are not applied to specific fields With the exception of the count function, when you pair the eventstats command with functions that are not applied to specific fields or eval expressions that resolve into fields, the search head processes it as if it were applied to a wildcard for all fields. In other words, when you have | eventstats avg in a search, it returns results for | eventstats avg(*). This \"implicit wildcard\" syntax is officially deprecated, however. Make the wildcard explicit. Write | eventstats <function>(*) when you want a function to apply to all possible fields. Functions and memory usage Some functions are inherently more expensive, from a memory standpoint, than other functions. For example, the distinct_count function requires far more memory than the count function. The values and list functions also can consume a lot of memory. If you are using the distinct_count function without a split-by field or with a low-cardinality split-by by field, consider replacing the distinct_count function with the the estdc function (estimated distinct count). The estdc function might result in significantly lower memory usage and run times. Event order functions Using the first and last functions when searching based on time does not produce accurate results. To locate the first value based on time order, use the earliest function, instead of the first function. To locate the last value based on time order, use the latest function, instead of the last function. For example, consider the following search. When you use the stats and eventstats commands for ordering events based on time, use the earliest and latest functions.

{"id": "4e910ad8a1f9b62f", "content": "The following example provides you with a better understanding of how the eventstats command works. This example is actually a progressive set of small examples, where one example builds on or extends the previous example. It's much easier to see what the eventstats command does by showing you examples, using a set of simple events. These examples use the makeresults command to create a set of events. The streamstats and eval commands are used to create additional fields in the events. Creating a set of events Let's start by creating a set of four events. One of the events contains a null value in the age field. The streamstats command is used to create the count field. The streamstats command calculates a cumulative count for each event, at the time the event is processed. The eval command is used to create two new fields, age and city. The eval command uses the value in the count field. The case function takes pairs of arguments, such as count=1, 25. The first argument is a Boolean expression. When that expression is TRUE, the corresponding second argument is returned. The results of the search look like this: Using eventstats with a BY clause The BY clause in the eventstats command is optional, but is used frequently with this command. The BY clause groups the generated statistics by the values in a field. You can use any of the statistical functions with the eventstats command to generate the statistics. See the Statistical and charting functions. In this example, the eventstats command generates the average age for each city. The generated averages are placed into a new field called avg(age). The following search is the same as the previous search, with the eventstats command added at the end: For San Francisco , the average age is 28 = (25 + 31) / 2. For Seattle , there is only one event with a value. The average is 39 = 39 / 1. The eventstats command places that average in every event for Seattle, including events that did not contain a value for age. The results of the search look like this: Renaming the new field By default, the name of the new field that is generated is the name of the statistical calculation. In these examples, that name is avg(age). You can rename the new field using the AS keyword. In the following search, the eventstats command has been adjusted to rename the new field to average age by city. The results of the search look like this: Events with text values The previous examples show how an event is processed that does not contain a value in the age field. Let's see how events are processed that contain an alphabetic character value in the field that you want to use to generate statistics. The following search includes the word test as a value in the age field. The results of the search look like this: Let's add the eventstats command to the search. The alphabetic values are treated like null values. The results of the search look like this: Using the allnum argument But suppose you don't want statistics generated when there are alphabetic characters in the field or the field is empty? The allnum argument controls how the eventstats command processes field values. The default setting for the allnum argument is FALSE. Which means that the field used to generate the statistics does not need to contain all numeric values. Fields with empty values or alphabetic character values are ignored. You've seen this in the earlier examples. You can force the eventstats command to generate statistics only when the fields contain all numeric values. To accomplish this, you can set the allnum argument to TRUE. The results of the search look like this: Because the age field contains values for Seattle that are not all numbers, the entire set of values for Seattle are ignored. No average is calculated. The allnum=true argument applies to empty values as well as alphabetic character values.", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults count=4 \n| streamstats count \n|evalage =case(count=1, 25, count=2, 39, count=3, 31, count=4, null())\n|evalcity =case(count=1 OR count=3,\"San Francisco\", count=2 OR count=4,\"Seattle\")"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults count=4 \n| streamstats count \n|evalage =case(count=1, 25, count=2, 39, count=3, 31, count=4, null())\n|evalcity =case(count=1 OR count=3,\"San Francisco\", count=2 OR count=4,\"Seattle\")\n| eventstats avg(age) BY city"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults count=4 \n| streamstats count \n|evalage =case(count=1, 25, count=2, 39, count=3, 31, count=4, null())\n|evalcity =case(count=1 OR count=3,\"San Francisco\", count=2 OR count=4,\"Seattle\")\n| eventstats avg(age) AS\"average age by city\"BY city"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults count=4 \n| streamstats count \n|evalage =case(count=1, 25, count=2, 39, count=3, 31, count=4,\"test\")\n|evalcity =case(count=1 OR count=3,\"San Francisco\", count=2 OR count=4,\"Seattle\")"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults count=4 \n| streamstats count \n|evalage =case(count=1, 25, count=2, 39, count=3, 31, count=4,\"test\")\n|evalcity =case(count=1 OR count=3,\"San Francisco\", count=2 OR count=4,\"Seattle\")\n| eventstats avg(age) BY city"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults count=4 \n| streamstats count \n|evalage =case(count=1, 25, count=2, 39, count=3, 31, count=4,\"test\")\n|evalcity =case(count=1 OR count=3,\"San Francisco\", count=2 OR count=4,\"Seattle\")\n| eventstats allnum=trueavg(age) BY city"}], "tables": [{"headers": ["_time", "age", "city", "count"], "rows": [["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "25", "San Francisco", "1"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "39", "Seattle", "2"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "31", "San Francisco", "3"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "", "Seattle", "4"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "age", "avg(age)", "city", "count"], "rows": [["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "25", "28", "San Francisco", "1"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "39", "39", "Seattle", "2"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "31", "28", "San Francisco", "3"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "", "39", "Seattle", "4"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "age", "average age by city", "city", "count"], "rows": [["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "25", "28", "San Francisco", "1"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "39", "39", "Seattle", "2"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "31", "28", "San Francisco", "3"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "", "39", "Seattle", "4"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "age", "city", "count"], "rows": [["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "25", "San Francisco", "1"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "39", "Seattle", "2"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "31", "San Francisco", "3"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "test", "Seattle", "4"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "age", "avg(age)", "city", "count"], "rows": [["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "25", "28", "San Francisco", "1"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "39", "39", "Seattle", "2"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "31", "28", "San Francisco", "3"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "test", "39", "Seattle", "4"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "age", "avg(age)", "city", "count"], "rows": [["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "25", "28", "San Francisco", "1"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "39", "", "Seattle", "2"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "31", "28", "San Francisco", "3"], ["2020-02-05 18:32:07", "test", "", "Seattle", "4"]]}], "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 6, "metadata": {"title": "eventstats", "section_heading": "Extended example", "section_id": "id_523b1747_d0a9_41c5_ae94_4cd1c82cc939--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/search-commands/eventstats", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Search Commands", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:29:29.835412+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

Usage You can use this function with the chart , mstats , stats , timechart , and tstats commands, and also with sparkline() charts. For a list of the related statistical and charting commands that you can use with this function, see Statistical and charting functions. Basic examples Example 1 The following example returns the average (mean) \"size\" for each distinct \"host\". Example 2 The following example returns the average \"thruput\" of each \"host\" for each 5 minute time span. Example 3 The following example charts the ratio of the average (mean) \"size\" to the maximum \"delay\" for each distinct \"host\" and \"user\" pair. Example 4 The following example displays a timechart of the average of cpu_seconds by processor, rounded to 2 decimal points. Extended examples Example 1 There are situations where the results of a calculation can return a different accuracy to the very far right of the decimal point. For example, the following search calculates the average of 100 values: The result of this calculation is: When the count is changed to 10000, the results are different: The result of this calculation is: This occurs because numbers are treated as double-precision floating-point numbers. To mitigate this issue, you can use the sigfig function to specify the number of significant figures you want returned. However, first you need to make a change to the stats command portion of the search. You need to change the name of the field avg(test) to remove the parenthesis. For example stats avg(test) AS test. The sigfig function expects either a number or a field name. The sigfig function cannot accept a field name that looks like another function, in this case avg. To specify the number of decimal places you want returned, you multiply the field name by 1 and use zeros to specify the number of decimal places. If you want 4 decimal places returned, you would multiply the field name by 1.0000. To return 2 decimal places, multiply by 1.00, as shown in the following example: The result of this calculation is: Example 2 Chart the average number of events in a transaction, based on transaction duration. Run the following search to create a chart to show the average number of events in a transaction based on the duration of the transaction. The transaction command adds two fields to the results duration and eventcount. The eventcount field tracks the number of events in a single transaction. In this search, the transactions are piped into the chart command. The avg() function is used to calculate the average number of events for each duration. Because the duration is in seconds and you expect there to be many values, the search uses the span argument to bucket the duration into bins using logarithm with a base of 2. Use the field format option to enable number formatting. Click the Visualization tab and change the display to a pie chart. Each wedge of the pie chart represents a duration for the event transactions. You can hover over a wedge to see the average values.", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "... | stats avg(size) BY host"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... | bin _time span=5m | stats avg(thruput) BY _time host"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... | charteval(avg(size)/max(delay)) AS ratio BY host user"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... | timecharteval(round(avg(cpu_seconds),2)) BY processor"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults count=100 |evaltest=3.99 | stats avg(test)"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults count=10000 |evaltest=3.99 | stats avg(test)"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults count=10000 |evaltest=3.99 | stats avg(test) AStest|evalnew_test=sigfig(test*1.00)"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_* status=200 action=purchase | transaction clientip maxspan=30m  | chart avg(eventcount) by duration span=log2"}], "tables": [{"headers": ["avg(test)"], "rows": [["3.9900000000000055"]]}, {"headers": ["avg(test)"], "rows": [["3.990000000000215"]]}, {"headers": ["test"], "rows": [["3.99"]]}, {"headers": [], "rows": [["This example uses the sample data from the Search Tutorial.

{"id": "cc6039e9b2fe5d24", "content": "Description The percentile functions return the Nth percentile value of the numeric field <value>. You can think of this as an estimate of where the top percentile starts. For example, a 95th percentile says that 95% of the values in field Y are below the estimate and 5% of the values in field <value> are above the estimate. Valid percentile values are floating point numbers between 0 and 100, such as 99.95. There are three different percentile functions that you can use: The percentile functions process field values as strings. Note: The perc and upperperc functions are, by their nature, nondeterministic, which means that that subsequent runs of searches using these functions over identical data can contain slight variances in their results. If you require exact and consistent results, you can use exactperc<X>(Y) instead. Usage You can use this function with the chart , mstats , stats , timechart , and tstats commands. Differences between Splunk and Excel percentile algorithms If there are less than 1000 distinct values, the Splunk percentile functions use the nearest rank algorithm. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percentile#Nearest_rank. Excel uses the NIST interpolated algorithm, which basically means you can get a value for a percentile that does not exist in the actual data, which is not possible for the nearest rank approach. Splunk algorithm with more than 1000 distinct values If there are more than 1000 distinct values for the field, the percentiles are approximated using a custom radix-tree digest-based algorithm. This algorithm is much faster and uses much less memory, a constant amount, than an exact computation, which uses memory in linear relation to the number of distinct values. By default this approach limits the approximation error to < 1% of rank error. That means if you ask for 95th percentile, the number you get back is between the 94th and 96th percentile. You always get the exact percentiles even for more than 1000 distinct values by using the exactperc function compared to the perc. Basic examples Consider this list of values Y = {10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1}. The following example returns 5.5. The following example returns 9.55. Extended example Consider the following set of data, which shows the number of visitors for each hour a store is open: This data resides in the visitor_count index. You can use the streamstats command to create a cumulative total for the visitors. The results from this search look like this: Let's add the stats command with the perc function to determine the 50th and 95th percentiles. The results from this search look like this: The perc50 estimates the 50th percentile, when 50% of the visitors had arrived. You can see from the data that the 50th percentile was reached between visitor number 1996 and 1997, which was sometime between 1200 and 1300 hours. The perc95 estimates the 95th percentile, when 95% of the visitors had arrived. The 95th percentile was reached with visitor 3858, which occurred between 1600 and 1700 hours.", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "...| stats perc50(Y)"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "...| stats perc95(Y)"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "index=visitor_count | streamstats sum(visitors) as'visitors total'"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "index=visitor_count | streamstats sum(visitors) as'visitors total'| stats perc50('visitors total') perc95('visitors total')"}], "tables": [{"headers": ["Function", "Description"], "rows": [["perc<percentile>(<value>) or the abbreviation p<percentile>(<value>)", "Use thepercfunction to calculate an approximate threshold, such that of the values in field Y, X percent fall below the threshold.

[ BY <row-split> <column-split> ] | [ OVER <row-split> ] [BY <column-split>] [<dedup_splitvals>] Required arguments You must include one of the following arguments when you use the chart command. stats-agg-term Syntax: <stats-func> ( <evaled-field> | <wc-field> ) [AS <wc-field>] Description: A statistical aggregation function. See Stats function options. The function can be applied to an eval expression, or to a field or set of fields. Use the AS clause to place the result into a new field with a name that you specify. You can use wildcard characters in field names. sparkline-agg-term Syntax: <sparkline-agg> [AS <wc-field>] Description: A sparkline aggregation function. Use the AS clause to place the result into a new field with a name that you specify. You can use wild card characters in field names. See Sparkline options. eval-expression Syntax: <eval-math-exp> | <eval-concat-exp> | <eval-compare-exp> | <eval-bool-exp> | <eval-function-call> Description: A combination of literals, fields, operators, and functions that represent the value of your destination field. For more information, see the Evaluation functions. See Usage. Note: For these evaluations to work, your values need to be valid for the type of operation. For example, with the exception of addition, arithmetic operations might not produce valid results if the values are not numerical. If both operands are strings, they can be concatenated. When concatenating values with a period, the search treats both values as strings regardless of their actual type. Optional arguments agg Syntax: agg=<stats-agg-term> Description: Specify an aggregator or function. For a list of stats functions with descriptions and examples, see Statistical and charting functions. chart-options Syntax: cont | format | limit | sep Description: Options that you can specify to refine the result. See the Chart options section in this topic. Default: column-split Syntax: <field> [<tc-options>]... [<where-clause>] Description: Specifies a field to use as the columns in the result table. By default, when the result are visualized, the columns become the data series in the chart. If the field is numerical, discretization is applied using the tc-options argument. See the tc options and the where clause sections in this topic. Default: The number of columns included is limited to 10 by default. You can change the number of columns by including a <where-clause>. Note: When a column-split field is included, the output is a table where each column represents a distinct value of the split-by field. This is in contrast with the by-clause , where each row represents a single unique combination of values of the group-by fields. For additional information, see the Usage section in this topic. dedup_splitvals Syntax: dedup_splitvals=<boolean> Description: Specifies whether to remove duplicate values in multivalued BY clause fields. Default: false row-split Syntax: <field> [<bin-options>]... Description: The field that you specify becomes the first column in the results table. The field values become the row labels in the results table. In a chart, the field name is used to label the X-axis. The field values become the X-axis values. See the Bin options section in this topic. Default: None. Chart options cont Syntax: cont=<bool> Description: Specifies if the bins are continuous. If cont=false, replots the x-axis so that a noncontinuous sequence of x-value bins show up adjacently in the output. If cont=true, bins that have no values will display with a count of 0 or null values. Default: true format Syntax: format=<string> Description: Used to construct output field names when multiple data series are used in conjunction with a split-by-field. format takes precedence over sep and allows you to specify a parameterized expression with the stats aggregator and function ($AGG$) and the value of the split-by-field ($VAL$). limit Syntax: limit=(top | bottom) <int> Description: Only valid when a column-split is specified. Use the limit option to specify the number of results that should appear in the output. When you set limit=N the top or bottom N values are retained, based on the sum of each series and the prefix you have selected. If limit=0 , all results are returned. If you opt not to provide a prefix, the Splunk software provides the top results. Default: top 10 sep Syntax: sep=<string> Description: Used to construct output field names when multiple data series are used in conjunctions with a split-by field. This is equivalent to setting format to $AGG$<sep>$VAL$. Stats function options stats-func Syntax: The syntax depends on the function you use. See Usage. Description: Statistical and charting functions that you can use with the chart command. Each time you invoke the chart command, you can use one or more functions. However, you can only use one BY clause. Sparkline options Sparklines are inline charts that appear within table cells in search results and display time-based trends associated with the primary key of each row. sparkline-agg Syntax: sparkline (count(<wc-field>), <span-length>) | sparkline (<sparkline-func>(<wc-field>), <span-length>) Description: A sparkline specifier, which takes the first argument of an aggregation function on a field and an optional timespan specifier. If no timespan specifier is used, an appropriate timespan is chosen based on the time range of the search. If the sparkline is not scoped to a field, only the count aggregate function is permitted. You can use wild card characters in field names. span-length See the Span options section in this topic. sparkline-func Syntax: c() | count() | dc() | mean() | avg() | stdev() | stdevp() | var() | varp() | sum() | sumsq() | min() | max() | range() Description: Aggregation function to use to generate sparkline values. Each sparkline value is produced by applying this aggregation to the events that fall into each particular time bin. Note: The size of the sparkline is defined by settings in the limits.conf file. The sparkline_maxsize setting defines the maximum number of elements to emit for a sparkline. For more information see Add sparklines to your search results in the Search Manual. Bin options The bin options control the number and size of the bins that the search results are separated, or discretized, into. Syntax: bins | span | <start-end> | aligntime Description: Discretization options. Default: bins=300 bins Syntax: bins=<int> Description: Sets the maximum number of bins to discretize into. For example, if bin=300, the search finds the smallest bin size that results in no more than 300 distinct bins. Default: 300 span Syntax: span=<log-span> | span=<span-length> Description: Sets the size of each bin, using a span length based on time or log-based span. See the Span options section in this topic. <start-end> Syntax: end=<num> | start=<num> Description: Sets the minimum and maximum extents for numerical bins. Data outside of the [start, end] range is discarded. aligntime Syntax: aligntime=(earliest | latest | <time-specifier>) Description: Align the bin times to something other than base UNIX time (epoch 0). The aligntime option is valid only when doing a time-based discretization. Ignored if span is in days, months, or years. Span options <log-span> Syntax: [<num>]log[<num>] Description: Sets to a logarithm-based span. The first number is a coefficient. The second number is the base. If the first number is supplied, it must be a real number >= 1.0 and < base. Base, if supplied, must be real number > 1.0 (strictly greater than 1). span-length Syntax: <span>[<timescale>] Description: A span length based on time. <span> Syntax: <int> Description: The span of each bin. If using a timescale, this is used as a time range. If not, this is an absolute bucket \"length.\" <timescale> Syntax: <sec> | <min> | <hr> | <day> | <month> | <subseconds> Description: Time scale units. tc options The timechart options are part of the <column-split> argument and control the behavior of splitting search results by a field. There are options that control the number and size of the bins that the search results are separated into. There are options that control what happens when events do not contain the split-by field, and for events that do not meet the criteria of the <where-clause>. tc-options Syntax: <bin-options> | usenull=<bool> | useother=<bool> | nullstr=<string> | otherstr=<string> Description: Options for controlling the behavior of splitting by a field. bin-options See the Bin options section in this topic. nullstr Syntax: nullstr=<string> Description: Specifies the name of the field for data series for events that do not contain the split-by field. The nullstri option is only applicable when the usenull option is set to true. Default: NULL otherstr String: otherstr=<string> Description: Specifies the name of the field for data series that do not meet the criteria of the <where-clause>. The otherstr option is only applicable when the useother option is set to true. Default: OTHER usenull Syntax: usenull=<bool> Description: Controls whether or not a series is created for events that do not contain the split-by field. Default: true useother Syntax: useother=<bool> Description: Specifies if a series should be added for data series not included in the graph because the series did not meet the criteria of the <where-clause>. Default: true where clause The <where-clause> is part of the <column-split> argument. where clause Syntax: <single-agg> <where-comp> Description: Specifies the criteria for including particular data series when a field is given in the tc-by-clause. The most common use of this option is to select for spikes rather than overall mass of distribution in series selection. The default value finds the top ten series by area under the curve. Alternately one could replace sum with max to find the series with the ten highest spikes. This has no relation to the where command. single-agg Syntax: count | <stats-func>(<field>) Description: A single aggregation applied to a single field, including an evaluated field. No wildcards are allowed. The field must be specified, except when using the count aggregate function, which applies to events as a whole. <stats-func> See the Statistical functions section in this topic. <where-comp> Syntax: <wherein-comp> | <wherethresh-comp> Description: The criteria for the <where-clause>. <wherein-comp> Syntax: (in | notin) (top | bottom)<int> Description: A grouping criteria for the <where-clause>. The aggregated series value be in or not in some top or bottom grouping. <wherethresh-comp> Syntax: ( < | > ) <num> Description: A threshold for the <where-clause>. The aggregated series value must be greater than or less than the specified numeric threshold.", "code_examples": [], "tables": [{"headers": ["Time scale", "Syntax", "Description"], "rows": [["<sec>", "s | sec | secs | second | seconds", "Time scale in seconds."], ["<min>", "m | min |  mins |  minute |  minutes", "Time scale in minutes."], ["<hr>", "h | hr |  hrs |  hour | hours", "Time scale in hours."], ["<day>", "d |  day | days", "Time scale in days."], ["<month>", "mon | month |  months", "Time scale in months."], ["<subseconds>", "us | ms |  cs |  ds", "Time scale in microseconds (us), milliseconds (ms), centiseconds (cs), or deciseconds (ds)"]]}], "chunk_index": 1, "total_chunks": 6, "metadata": {"title": "chart", "section_heading": "Syntax", "section_id": "id_81ec59ca_0536_40e8_aff5_9a63c2212cd0--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/search-commands/chart", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Search Commands", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:30:04.542867+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}
{"id": "e340c3e52c6cbd4f", "content": "The chart command is a transforming command. See Command types. Evaluation expressions You can use the chart command with an eval expression. Unless you specify a split-by clause, the eval expression must be renamed. Supported functions You can use a wide range of functions with the stats command. For general information about using functions, see Statistical and charting functions. For a list of statistical functions by category, see Function list by category For an alphabetical list of statistical functions, see Alphabetical list of functions Functions and memory usage Some functions are inherently more expensive, from a memory standpoint, than other functions. For example, the distinct_count function requires far more memory than the count function. The values and list functions also can consume a lot of memory. If you are using the distinct_count function without a split-by field or with a low-cardinality split-by by field, consider replacing the distinct_count function with the the estdc function (estimated distinct count). The estdc function might result in significantly lower memory usage and run times. Apply a statistical function to all available fields Some statistical commands, such as stats , process functions that are not paired with one or more fields as if they are implicitly paired with a wildcard, so the command applies the function all available fields. For example, | stats sum is treated as if it is | stats sum(*). The chart command allows this behavior only with the count function. If you do not specify a field for count , chart applies it to all events returned by the search. If you want to apply other functions to all fields, you must make the wildcard explicit: | chart sum(*). X-axis You can specify which field is tracked on the x-axis of the chart. The x-axis variable is specified with a by field and is discretized if necessary. Charted fields are converted to numerical quantities if necessary. Unlike the timechart command which generates a chart with the _time field as the x-axis, the chart command produces a table with an arbitrary field as the x-axis. You can also specify the x-axis field after the over keyword, before any by and subsequent split-by clause. The limit and agg options allow easier specification of series filtering. The limit and agg options are ignored if an explicit where-clause is provided. Using row-split and column-split fields When a column-split field is included, the output is a table where each column represents a distinct value of the column-split field. This is in contrast with the stats command, where each row represents a single unique combination of values of the group-by fields. The number of columns included is limited to 10 by default. You can change the number of columns by including a where-clause. With the chart and timechart commands, you cannot specify the same field in a function and as the row-split field. For example, you cannot run this search. The field A is specified in the sum function and the row-split argument. You must specify a different field as in the row-split argument. Alternatively, you can work around this problem by using an eval expression. For example: Subsecond bin time spans Subsecond span timescales, which are time spans that are made up of deciseconds (ds), centiseconds (cs), milliseconds (ms), or microseconds (us), should be numbers that divide evenly into a second. For example, 1s = 1000ms. This means that valid millisecond span values are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, or 500ms. In addition, span = 1000ms is not allowed. Use span = 1s instead.", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "... | chart sum(A) by A span=log2"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... |evalA1=A | chart sum(A) by A1 span=log2"}], "tables": [], "chunk_index": 2, "total_chunks": 6, "metadata": {"title": "chart", "section_heading": "Usage", "section_id": "f2af5a1c_1311_4740_a2c5_f4a6bab63174--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/search-commands/chart", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Search Commands", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:30:04.542875+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

{"id": "52d46d1fe6de7efa", "content": "1. Specify <row-split> and <column-split> values with the chart command This example uses events that list the numeric sales for each product and quarter, for example: To summarize the data by product for each quarter, run this search: In this example, there are two fields specified in the BY clause with the chart command. The products field is referred to as the <row-split> field. In the chart, this field forms the X-axis. The quarter field is referred to as the <column-split> field. In the chart, this field forms the data series. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: Click on the Visualization tab to see the results as a chart. See the addtotals command for an example that adds a total column for each product. 2. Chart the number of different page requests for each Web server Chart the number of different page requests, GET and POST, that occurred for each Web server. This example uses eval expressions to specify the different field values for the stats command to count. The first clause uses the count() function to count the Web access events that contain the method field value GET. Then, using the AS keyword, the field that represents these results is renamed GET. The second clause does the same for POST events. The counts of both types of events are then separated by the web server, using the BY clause with the host field. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look like this: Click the Visualization tab. If necessary, format the results as a column chart. This chart displays the total count of events for each event type, GET or POST, based on the host value. 3. Chart the number of transactions by duration Create a chart to show the number of transactions based on their duration (in seconds). This search uses the transaction command to define a transaction as events that share the clientip field and fit within a ten minute time span. The transaction command creates a new field called duration , which is the difference between the timestamps for the first and last events in the transaction. (Because maxspan=10s , the duration value should not be greater than this.) The transactions are then piped into the chart command. The count() function is used to count the number of transactions and separate the count by the duration of each transaction. Because the duration is in seconds and you expect there to be many values, the search uses the span argument to bucket the duration into bins of log2 ( span=log2 ). The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: Click the Visualization tab. If necessary, format the results as a column chart. In this data set, most transactions take between 0 and 2 seconds to complete. 4. Chart the average number of events in a transaction, based on transaction duration Create a chart to show the average number of events in a transaction based on the duration of the transaction. The transaction command adds two fields to the results duration and eventcount. The eventcount field tracks the number of events in a single transaction. In this search, the transactions are piped into the chart command. The avg() function is used to calculate the average number of events for each duration. Because the duration is in seconds and you expect there to be many values, the search uses the span argument to bucket the duration into bins using logarithm with a base of 2. Use the field format option to enable number formatting. Click the Visualization tab and change the display to a pie chart. Each wedge of the pie chart represents a duration for the event transactions. You can hover over a wedge to see the average values. 5. Chart customer purchases Chart how many different people bought something and what they bought at the Buttercup Games online store Yesterday. This search takes the purchase events and pipes it into the chart command. The dc() or distinct_count() function is used to count the number of unique visitors (characterized by the clientip field). This number is then charted over each hour of the day and broken out based on the category_id of the purchase. Also, because these are numeric values, the search uses the usenull=f argument to exclude fields that don't have a value. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: Click the Visualization tab. If necessary, format the results as a line chart: Each line represents a different type of product that is sold at the Buttercup Games online store. The height of each line shows the number of different people who bought the product during that hour. In general, it looks like the most popular items at the online shop were Arcade games. You can format the report as a stacked column chart, which will show you the total purchases at each hour of day. Change the chart type to a Column Chart. Use the Format menu, and on the General tab select stacked. 6. Chart the number of earthquakes and the magnitude of each earthquake Create a chart that list the number of earthquakes, and the magnitude of each earthquake that occurred in and around Alaska. Run the search using the time range All time. This search counts the number of earthquakes that occurred in the Alaska regions. The count is then broken down for each place based on the magnitude of the quake. Because the place value is non-numeric, the search uses the useother=f argument to exclude events that don't match. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: Click on the Visualization tab to view the results on a chart.

In these cases you can apply a wildcard to catch all of the permutations of the metric_name. See Stats metric term options for details on the <stats-func> and <stats-func-value> syntax options. Optional arguments append Syntax: append=<bool> Description: Valid only when prestats=true. This argument runs the mstats command and adds the results to an existing set of results instead of generating new results. Default: false backfill Syntax: backfill=<bool> Description: Valid only with real-time searches that have a time window. When backfill=true , the mstats command runs a search on historical data to backfill events before searching the in-memory real-time data. Default: true chart Syntax: chart=<bool> Description: When set to chart=t , the mstats data output has a format suitable for charting. The mstats charting mode is valid only when prestats=f. When a span is provided, the mstats chart mode format resembles that of the timechart command, and can support at most one group-by field, which is used as the series splitting field. When no span is provided, the chart mode follows a format similar to that of the chart or timechart commands. Without a span , the mstats chart mode requires one or two grouping fields. The first grouping field represents the chart x-axis. The second grouping field represents the y-axis and is a series split field. Default: chart=f <chart-options> Syntax: chart.limit | chart.agg | chart.usenull | chart.useother | chart.nullstr | chart.otherstr Description: Options that you can specify to refine the result. See the Chart options section in this topic. chunk_size Syntax: chunk_size=<unsigned_int> Description: Advanced option. This argument controls how many metric time series are retrieved at a time from a single time-series index file ( .tsidx file) when the Splunk software processes searches. Lower this setting from its default only when you find a particular mstats search is using too much memory, or when it infrequently returns events. This can happen when a search groups by excessively high-cardinality dimensions (dimensions with very large amounts of distinct values). In such situations, a lower chunk_size value can make mstats searches more responsive, but potentially slower to complete. A higher chunk_size , on the other hand, can help long-running searches to complete faster, with the potential tradeoff of causing the search to be less responsive. For mstats , chunk_size cannot be set lower than 10000. Default: 10000000 (10 million) fillnull_value Description: This argument sets a user-specified value that the mstats command substitutes for null values for any field within its group-by field list. Null values include field values that are missing from a subset of the returned events as well as field values that are missing from all of the returned events. If you do not provide a fillnull_value argument, mstats omits rows for events with one or more null field values from its results. Default: empty string <field-list> Syntax: <field>, ... Description: Specifies one or more fields to group the results by. Required when using the BY clause. <logical-expression> Syntax: <time-opts>|<search-modifier>|((NOT)? <logical-expression>)|<search-modifier>|<comparison-expression>|(<logical-expression> (OR)? <logical-expression>) Description: An expression describing the filters that are applied to your search. Includes time and search modifiers, and comparison expressions. See the following sections for descriptions of each of these logical expression components. Cannot filter on metric_name. Does not support CASE or TERM directives. You also cannot use the WHERE clause to search for terms or phrases. prestats Syntax: prestats=true | false Description: Specifies whether to use the prestats format. The prestats format is a Splunk internal format that is designed to be consumed by commands that generate aggregate calculations. When you use the prestats format, you can pipe the data into the chart , stats , or timechart commands, which are designed to accept the prestats format. When prestats is set to true , instructions with the AS clause are not relevant. The field names for the aggregates are determined by the command that consumes the prestats format and produces the aggregate output. Default: false <span-length> Syntax: span=<int><timescale> [every=<int><timescale>] Description: The span of each time bin. If used with a <timescale> , the <span-length> is treated as a time range. If not, this is an absolute bucket length. If you do not specify a <span-length> , the default is auto , which means that the number of time buckets adjusts to produce a reasonable number of results. For example, if seconds are used initially for the <timescale> and too many results are returned, the <timescale> is changed to a longer value, such as minutes, to return fewer time buckets. To improve the performance of mstats searches you can optionally use the every argument in conjunction with span to cause the search to reduce the amount of data it samples per span. In other words you could design a search where the search head samples a span of only ten minutes of data for every hour covered by the search. See Span length options. update_period Syntax: update_period=<integer> Description: Valid only with real-time searches. Specifies how frequently, in milliseconds, the real-time summary for the mstats command is updated. A larger number means less frequent updates to the summary and less impact on index processing. Default: 1000 (1 second) Stats metric term options <stats-func> Syntax: <stats-func> | <mstats-specific-func> \"(\"<metric_name>\")\" [AS <string>]... Description: Perform statistical calculations on one or more metric_name fields. You can rename the result of each function using the AS clause, unless prestats is set to true. The metric_name must be enclosed in parenthesis. When you use the <stats-func> syntax, the WHERE clause cannot filter on metric_name. <mstats-specific-func> Syntax: rate_avg | rate_sum Description: Two functions that are specific to mstats. rate_avg computes the per metric time series rates for an accumulating counter metric and then returns the average of those rates. rate_sum does the same thing as rate_avg except that it returns the sum of the rates. For more about counter metrics and these functions see Investigate counter metrics in Metrics. <stats-func-value> Syntax: count(_value) | <function>(_value) [AS <string>] WHERE metric_name=<metric_name> Description: Specify a basic count of the _value field or a function on the _value field. The _value field uses a specific format to store the numeric value of the metric. You can specify one or more functions. You can rename the result of the function using AS unless prestats=true. When you use the <stats-func-value> syntax, the WHERE clause must filter on the metric_name. Wildcards are okay. Note: The stats-func-value syntax does not support real-time searches. If you must run a real-time search, use the stats-func syntax instead. The following table lists the supported functions for the mstats command by type of function. Use the links in the table to see descriptions and examples for each function. For an overview of using functions with commands, see Statistical and charting functions. Chart options chart.limit Syntax: chart.limit=(top | bottom)<int> Description: Only valid when a column-split is specified. Use the chart.limit option to specify the number of results that should appear in the output. When you set chart.limit=N the top or bottom N values are retained, based on the sum of each series and the prefix you have selected. If chart.limit=0 , all results are returned. If you opt not to provide a top or bottom prefix before the chart.limit value, the Splunk software provides the top N results. For example, if you set chart.limit=10 the Splunk software defaults to providing the top 10 results. This argument is identical to the limit argument of the chart and timechart commands. Default: top10 chart.agg Syntax: chart.agg=( <stats-func> ( <evaled-field> | <wc-field> ) [AS <wc-field>] ) Description: A statistical aggregation function. See the table of supported functions in Stats metric term options. The function can be applied to an eval expression, or to a field or set of fields. Use the AS clause to place the result into a new field with a name that you specify. You can use wild card characters in field names. This argument is identical to the agg argument of the chart and timechart commands. Default: sum chart.nullstr Syntax: chart.nullstr=<string> Description: If chart.usenull is true, this series is labeled by the value of the chart.nullstr option, and defaults to NULL. This argument is identical to the nullstr argument of the chart and timechart commands. chart.otherstr Syntax: chart.otherstr=<string> Description: If chart.useother is true, this series is labeled by the value of the code.otherstr option, and defaults to OTHER. This argument is identical to the otherstr argument of the chart and timechart commands. chart.usenull Syntax: chart.usenull=<bool> Description: Determines whether a series is created for events that do not contain the split-by field. This argument is identical to the usenull argument of the chart and timechart commands. chart.useother Syntax: chart.useother=<bool> Description: Specifies whether a series should be added for data series not included in the graph because they did not meet the criteria of the WHERE clause. This argument is identical to the useother argument of the chart and timechart commands. Logical expression options <comparison-expression> Syntax: <field><comparison-operator><value> | <field> IN (<value-list>) Description: Compares a field to a literal value or provides a list of values that can appear in the field. <search-modifier> Syntax: <sourcetype-specifier> | <host-specifier> | <source-specifier> | <splunk_server-specifier> Description: Search for events from specified fields. For example, search for one or a combination of hosts, sources, and source types. See searching with default fields in the Knowledge Manager manual. <time-opts> Syntax: [<timeformat>] (<time-modifier>)* Description: Describes the format of the <starttime> and <endtime> terms of the search. Comparison expression options <comparison-operator> Syntax: = | != | < | <= | > | >= Description: Use comparison expressions when searching field-value pairs. Comparison expressions with the equal ( = ) or not equal ( != ) operator compare string values. For example, \"1\" does not match \"1.0\". Comparison expressions with greater than or less than operators < > <= >= numerically compare two numbers and lexicographically compare other values. See Usage. <field> Syntax: <string> Description: The name of a field. <value> Syntax: <literal-value> Description: In comparison expressions, this is the literal number or string value of a field. <value-list> Syntax: (<literal-value>, <literal-value>, ...) Description: Used with the IN operator to specify two or more values. For example use error IN (400, 402, 404, 406) instead of error=400 OR error=402 OR error=404 OR error=406. Search modifier options <sourcetype-specifier> Syntax: sourcetype=<string> Description: Search for events from the specified sourcetype field. <host-specifier> Syntax: host=<string> Description: Search for events from the specified host field. <source-specifier> Syntax: source=<string> Description: Search for events from the specified source field. <splunk_server-specifier> Syntax: splunk_server=<string> Description: Search for events from a specific server. Use \"local\" to refer to the search head. Span length options every Syntax : every=<int><timescale> Description : Use in conjunction with span to search data in discrete time intervals over the full timespan of a search. The every argument is valid only when span is set to a valid value other than auto. Set the every timespan to a value that is greater than the span timespan. This method of \"downsampling\" the search data improves search performance at the expense of data granularity. For example, this search returns an average of the active_logins measurement for the first ten seconds of every twenty seconds covered by the time range of the search: | mstats avg(active_logins) span=10s every=20s Note: Month intervals for every are exactly 30 days long. Year intervals for every are exactly 365 days long. <timescale> Syntax: <sec> | <min> | <hr> | <day> | <month> | <subseconds> Description: Time scale units. Default: sec Note: mstats only supports subsecond timescales such as ms when it is searching metric indexes that are configured for millisecond timestamp resolution. For more information about enabling metrics indexes to index metric data points with millisecond timestamp precision, see: Manage Splunk Cloud Platform indexes in the Splunk Cloud Platform Admin Manual if you use Splunk Cloud Platform. Create custom indexes in Managing indexers and clusters of indexers if you use Splunk Enterprise. Time options <timeformat> Syntax: timeformat=<string> Description: Set the time format for starttime and endtime terms. Default: timeformat=%m/%d/%Y:%H:%M:%S. For more about setting exact times with the available timeformat options, see Date and time format variables. Subsecond options are only available if you are searching over a metrics index with millisecond timestamp resolution. <time-modifier> Syntax: starttime=<string> | endtime=<string> | earliest=<time_modifier> | latest=<time_modifier> Description: Specify start and end times using relative or absolute time. Note: You can also use the earliest and latest arguments to specify absolute and relative time ranges for your search. For more about the relative <time_modifier> syntax, see Time modifiers. For more information about setting absolute time ranges see Date and time format variables. Subsecond options are only available if you are searching over a metrics index with millisecond timestamp resolution. starttime Syntax: starttime=<string> Description: Events must be later or equal to this time. The starttime must match the timeformat. endtime Syntax: endtime=<string> Description: All events must be earlier or equal to this time.", "code_examples": [], "tables": [{"headers": ["Type of function", "Supported functions and syntax", "", ""], "rows": [["Aggregate functions", "avg()count()max()median()min()", "perc<num>range()stdev()stdevp()", "sum()sumsq()upperperc<num>var()varp()"], ["Time functions", "earliest()earliest_time()latest()", "latest_time()rate()", "rate_avg()rate_sum()"]]}, {"headers": ["Time scale", "Syntax", "Description"], "rows": [["<sec>", "s | sec | secs | second | seconds", "Time scale in seconds."], ["<min>", "m | min |  mins |  minute |  minutes", "Time scale in minutes."], ["<hr>", "h | hr |  hrs |  hour | hours", "Time scale in hours."], ["<day>", "d |  day | days", "Time scale in days."], ["<month>", "mon | month |  months", "Time scale in months."], ["<subseconds>", "us | ms |  cs |  ds", "Time scale in microseconds (us), milliseconds (ms), centiseconds (cs), or deciseconds (ds)"]]}], "chunk_index": 1, "total_chunks": 5, "metadata": {"title": "mstats", "section_heading": "Syntax", "section_id": "id_9c7b826e_8ef9_4c54_b5c2_ed807a11991c--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/search-commands/mstats", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Search Commands", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:30:42.277753+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}
{"id": "dd052bc53457bcdc", "content": "The mstats command is a report-generating command , except when append=true. See Command types. Generating commands use a leading pipe character and should be the first command in a search, except when append=true is specified with the command. Use the mstats command to search metrics data. The metrics data uses a specific format for the metrics fields. See Metrics data format in Metrics. Note: All metrics search commands are case sensitive. This means, for example, that mstats treats as the following as three distinct values of metric_name : cap.gear , CAP.GEAR , and Cap.Gear. mstats searches cannot return results for metric data points with metric_name fields that are empty or which contain blank spaces. Append mstats searches together The mstats command does not support subsearches. You can use the append argument to add the results of an mstats search to the results of a preceding mstats search. See the topic on the tstats command for an append usage example. Aggregations If you are using the <stats-func> syntax, numeric aggregations are only allowed on specific values of the metric_name field. The metric name must be enclosed in parenthesis. If there is no data for the specified metric_name in parenthesis, the search is still valid. If you are using the <stats-func-value> syntax, numeric aggregations are only allowed on the _value field. Aggregations are not allowed for values of any other field, including the _time field. Note: When prestats = true and you run an mstats search that uses the c and count aggregation functions without an aggregation field, the Splunk software processes them as if they are actually count(_value). In addition, any statistical functions that follow in the search string must reference the _value field. For example: | mstats count | timechart count(_value) Wildcard characters The mstats command supports wildcard characters in any search filter, with the following exceptions: You cannot use wildcard characters in the GROUP BY clause. If you are using the <stats_func_value> syntax, you cannot use wildcard characters in the _value field. If you are using wildcard characters in your aggregations and you are renaming them, your rename must have matching wildcards. For example, this search is invalid: This search is valid: Real-time mstats searches cannot utilize wildcarded metric aggregations when you use the <stats-func> syntax. For example, this search is invalid, when you set it up as a real-time search: This real-time search is valid: WHERE clause Use the WHERE clause to filter by any of the supported dimensions. If you are using the <stats-func> syntax, the WHERE clause cannot filter by metric_name. Filtering by metric_name is performed based on the metric_name fields specified with the <stats-func> argument. If you are using the <stats-func-value> syntax, the WHERE clause must filter by metric_name. The WHERE clause is case-sensitive when it filters mstats results by field values. For example, these two searches return different result sets: If you do not specify an index name in the WHERE clause, the mstats command returns results from the default metrics indexes associated with your role. If you do not specify an index name and you have no default metrics indexes associated with your role, mstats returns no results. To search against all metrics indexes use WHERE index=*. The WHERE clause must come before the BY or GROUPBY clause, if they are both used in conjunction with mstats. For more information about defining default metrics indexes for a role, see Add and edit roles with Splunk Web in Securing Splunk Enterprise. Group results by metric name and dimension You can group results by the metric_name and dimension fields. You can also group by time. You must specify a timespan using the <span-length> argument to group by time buckets. For example, span=1hr or span=auto. The <span-length> argument is separate from the BY clause and can be placed at any point in the search between clauses. Grouping by the _value or _time fields is not allowed. Group by metric time series You can group results by metric time series. A metric time series is a set of metric data points that share the same metrics and the same dimension field-value pairs. Grouping by metric time series ensures that you are not mixing up data points from different metric data sources when you perform statistical calculations on them. Use BY _timeseries to group by metric time series. The _timeseries field is internal and won't display in your results. If you want to display the _timeseries values in your search, add | rename _timeseries AS timeseries to the search. For a detailed overview of the _timeseries field with examples, see Perform statistical calculations on metric time series in Metrics. Time dimensions The mstats command does not recognize the following time-related dimensions. Subsecond bin time spans You can only use subsecond span timescales, which are time spans that are made up of deciseconds (ds), centiseconds (cs), milliseconds (ms), or microseconds (us), for mstats searches over metrics indexes that have been configured to have millisecond timestamp resolution. Subsecond span timescales should be numbers that divide evenly into a second. For example, 1s = 1000ms. This means that valid millisecond span values are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, or 500ms. In addition, span = 1000ms is not allowed. Use span = 1s instead. For more information about giving indexes millisecond timestamp resolution: For Splunk Cloud Platform: See Manage Splunk Cloud Platform indexes in the Splunk Cloud Platform Admin Manual. For Splunk Enterprise: See Create custom indexes in Managing indexes and clusters of indexes. Search over a set of indexes with varying levels of timestamp resolution If you run an mstats search over multiple metrics indexes with varying levels of timestamp resolution, the results of the search may contain results with timestamps of different resolutions. For example, say you have two metrics indexes. Your \"metrics-second\" metrics index has a second timestamp resolution. Your \"metrics-ms\" metrics index has a millisecond timestamp resolution. You run the following search over both indexes: | mstats count(*) WHERE index=metric* span=100ms. The search produces the following results: The 11549496110 row counts results from both indexes. The count from \"metric-ms\" includes only metric data points with timestamps from 1549496110.000 to 1549496110.099. The \"metric-ms\" metric data points with timestamps from 1549496110.100 to 1549496110.199 appear in the 1549496110.100 row. Meanwhile, the metric data points in the \"metric-second\" index do not have millisecond timestamp precision. The 1549496110 row only counts those \"metric-second\" metric data points with the 11549496110 timestamp, and no metric data points from \"metric-second\" are counted in the 1549496110.100 row. Time bin limits for mstats search jobs Splunk software regulates mstats search jobs that use span or a similar method to group results by time. When Splunk software processes these jobs, it limits the number of \"time bins\" that can be allocated within a single .tsidx file. For metrics indexes with second timestamp resolution, this only affects searches with large time ranges and very small time spans, such as a search over a year with span = 1s. If you are searching on a metrics index with millisecond timestamp resolution, you might encounter this limit over shorter ranges, such as a search over an hour with span = 1ms. This limit is set by time_bin_limit in limits.conf , which is set to 1 million bins by default. If you need to run these kinds of mstats search jobs, lower this value if they are using too much memory per search. Raise this value if these kinds of search jobs are returning errors. The Splunk platform estimates the number of time bins that a search requires by dividing the search time range by its group-by span. If this produces a number that is larger than the time_bin_limit , the Splunk platform returns an error. The search time range is determined by the earliest and latest values of the search. Some kinds of searches, such as all-time searches, do not have earliest and latest. In such cases the Splunk platform checks within each single TSIDX file to derive a time range for the search. Note: Metrics indexes have second timestamp resolution by default. You can give a metrics index a millisecond timestamp resolution when you create it, or you can edit an existing metrics index to switch it to millisecond timestamp resolution. If you use Splunk Cloud, see Manage Splunk Cloud Platform indexes in the Splunk Cloud Platform Admin Manual. If you use Splunk Enterprise, see Create custom indexes in Managing indexes and clusters of indexes. Memory and mstats search performance A pair of limits.conf settings strike a balance between the performance of mstats searches and the amount of memory they use during the search process, in RAM and on disk. If your mstats searches are consistently slow to complete you can adjust these settings to improve their performance, but at the cost of increased search-time memory usage, which can lead to search failures. If you use Splunk Cloud Platform, you will need to file a Support ticket to change these settings. For more information, see Memory and stats search performance in the Search Manual. Lexicographical order Lexicographical order sorts items based on the values used to encode the items in computer memory. In Splunk software, this is almost always UTF-8 encoding, which is a superset of ASCII. Numbers are sorted before letters. Numbers are sorted based on the first digit. For example, the numbers 10, 9, 70, 100 are sorted lexicographically as 10, 100, 70, 9. Uppercase letters are sorted before lowercase letters. Symbols are not standard. Some symbols are sorted before numeric values. Other symbols are sorted before or after letters. You can specify a custom sort order that overrides the lexicographical order. See the blog Order Up!

{"id": "d758f7c46ad7a9cc", "content": "Description The values function returns a list of the distinct values in a field as a multivalue entry. The order of the values is lexicographical. Usage You can use the values(X) function with the chart , stats , timechart , and tstats commands. By default there is no limit to the number of values returned. Users with the appropriate permissions can specify a limit in the limits.conf file. You specify the limit in the [stats | sistats] stanza using the maxvalues setting. This function processes field values as strings. Lexicographical order Lexicographical order sorts items based on the values used to encode the items in computer memory. In Splunk software, this is almost always UTF-8 encoding, which is a superset of ASCII. Numbers are sorted before letters. Numbers are sorted based on the first digit. For example, the numbers 10, 9, 70, 100 are sorted lexicographically as 10, 100, 70, 9. Uppercase letters are sorted before lowercase letters. Symbols are not standard. Some symbols are sorted before numeric values. Other symbols are sorted before or after letters.

The first seen value of the field is the most recent instance of this field, based on the order in which the events are seen by the stats command. The order in which the events are seen is not necessarily chronological order. Usage You can use this function with the chart , stats , and timechart commands. To locate the first value based on time order, use the earliest function instead. This function works best when the search includes the sort command immediately before the statistics or charting command. This function processes field values as strings. Basic example You run the following search to locate invalid user login attempts against a specific sshd (Secure Shell Daemon). You use the table command to see the values in the _time , source , and _raw fields. The results look something like this: You extend the search using the first function. The search returns the value for _raw field with the timestamp 2020-04-28 00:15:05 , which is the first event in the original list of values returned. Extended example The Basic example uses the _raw field to show how the first function works. That's useful because the _raw field contains a timestamp. However, you can use the first function on any field. Let's start by creating some results. You can use the makeresults command to create a series of results to test your search syntax. Include the streamstats command to count your results: The results look like this: With the count field, you can create different dates in the _time field, using the eval command. Use 3600, the number of seconds in an hour, to create a series of hours. The calculation multiplies the value in the count field by the number of seconds in an hour. The result is subtracted from the original _time field to get new dates equivalent to 1 hours ago, 2 hours ago, and so forth. The results look like this: The hours in the results begin with the 1 hour earlier than the original date, 2020-05-09 at 14:24. The minutes and seconds are slightly different because the date is refreshed each time you run the search. Use the eval command to add a field to your search with values in descending order: The results look like this: As you can see from the results, the first result contains the highest number in field1. This shows the order in which the results were processed. The first result was processed first (20-1=19) followed by the remaining results in order.

{"id": "2533a6794b609a05", "content": "The streamstats command is a centralized streaming command. See Command types. The streamstats command is similar to the eventstats command except that it uses events before the current event to compute the aggregate statistics that are applied to each event. If you want to include the current event in the statistical calculations, use current=true , which is the default. The streamstats command is also similar to the stats command in that streamstats calculates summary statistics on search results. Unlike stats , which works on the group of results as a whole, streamstats calculates statistics for each event at the time the event is seen. Statistical functions that are not applied to specific fields With the exception of the count function, when you pair the streamstats command with functions that are not applied to specific fields or eval expressions that resolve into fields, the search head processes it as if it were applied to a wildcard for all fields. In other words, when you have | streamstats avg in a search, it returns results for | stats avg(*). This \"implicit wildcard\" syntax is officially deprecated, however. Make the wildcard explicit. Write | streamstats <function>(*) when you want a function to apply to all possible fields. Escaping string values If your <eval-expression> contains a value instead of a field name, you must escape the quotation marks around the value. The following example is a simple way to see this. Start by using the makeresults command to create 3 events. Use the streamstats command to produce a cumulative count of the events. Then use the eval command to create a simple test. If the value of the count field is equal to 2, display yes in the test field. Otherwise display no in the test field. The results appear something like this: Use the streamstats command to reset the count when the match is true. You must escape the quotation marks around the word yes. The following example shows the complete search. Here is another example. You want to look for the value session is closed in the description field. Because the value is a string, you must enclose it in quotation marks. You then need to escape those quotation marks. The reset_on_change argument You have a dataset with the field \"shift\" that contains either the value DAY or the value NIGHT. You run this search: If the dataset is: shift DAY DAY NIGHT NIGHT NIGHT NIGHT DAY NIGHT Running the command with reset_on_change=true produces the following streamstats results: shift , count DAY, 1 DAY, 2 NIGHT, 1 NIGHT, 2 NIGHT, 3 NIGHT, 4 DAY, 1 NIGHT, 1 Memory and maximum results The streamstats search processor uses two limits.conf settings to determine the maximum number of results that it can store in memory for the purpose of computing statistics. The maxresultrows setting specifies a top limit for the window argument. This sets the number of result rows that the streamstats command processor can store in memory. The max_mem_usage_mb setting limits how much memory the streamstats command uses to keep track of information. When the max_mem_usage_mb limit is reached, the streamstats command processor stops adding the requested fields to the search results. Do not set max_mem_usage_mb=0 as this removes the bounds to the amount of memory the streamstats command processor can use. This can lead to search failures. Prerequisites Only users with file system access, such as system administrators, can increase the maxresultrows and max_mem_usage_mb settings using configuration files. Review the steps in How to edit a configuration file in the Splunk Enterprise Admin Manual. You can have configuration files with the same name in your default, local, and app directories. Read Where you can place (or find) your modified configuration files in the Splunk Enterprise Admin Manual. CAUTION: Never change or copy the configuration files in the default directory.

{"id": "7c99f074a28c38ef", "content": "1. Create events for testing You can use the streamstats command with the makeresults command to create a series events. This technique is often used for testing search syntax. The eval command is used to create events with different hours. You use 3600, the number of seconds in an hour, in the eval command. The makeresults command is used to create the count field. The streamstats command calculates a cumulative count for each event, at the time the event is processed. The results look something like this: Notice that the hours in the timestamp are 1 hour apart. You can create additional fields by using the eval command. The eval command is used to create two new fields, age and city. The eval command uses the value in the count field. The case function takes pairs of arguments, such as count=1, 25. The first argument is a Boolean expression. When that expression is TRUE, the corresponding second argument is returned. The results of the search look like this: 2. Calculate a snapshot of summary statistics You want to determine the number of the bytes used over a set period of time. The following search uses the first 5 events. Because search results typically display the most recent event first, the sort command is used to sort the 5 events in ascending order to see the oldest event first and the most recent event last. Ascending order enables the streamstats command to calculate statistics over time. Add the streamstats command to the search to generate a running total of the bytes over the 5 events and organize the results by clientip. When you click on the ASimpleSumOfBytes field in the list of Interesting fields , an information window shows the cumulative sum of the bytes, as shown in this image: The streamstats command aggregates the statistics to the original data, which means that all of the original data is accessible for further calculations. Add the table command to the search to display the only the values in the _time , clientip , bytes , and ASimpleSumOfBytes fields. Each event shows the timestamp for the event, the clientip, and the number of bytes used. The ASimpleSumOfBytes field shows a cumulative summary of the bytes for each clientip. 3. Calculate the running total of distinct users over time Each day you track unique users, and you would like to track the cumulative count of distinct users. This example calculates the running total of distinct users over time. The bin command breaks the time into days. The stats command calculates the distinct users (clientip) and user count per day. The streamstats command finds the running distinct count of users. This search returns a table that includes: day , ips , dc(clientip) , and Cumulative total. 4. Calculate hourly cumulative totals This example uses streamstats to produce hourly cumulative totals. This search returns 3 columns: _time, SumOfBytes, and accu_total_SumOfBytes. The timechart command buckets the events into spans of 1 hour and counts the total values for each category. The timechart command also fills NULL values, so that there are no missing values. Then, the streamstats command is used to calculate the accumulated total. This example uses streamstats to produce hourly cumulative totals for category values. 5. Calculate when a DHCP IP lease address changed for a specific MAC address This example uses streamstats to figure out when a DHCP IP lease address changed for a MAC address, 54:00:00:00:00:00. You can also clean up the presentation to display a table of the DHCP IP address changes and the times the occurred. 6. Compare a number with itself over a few months Say a community needs to find out how their vaccination booster campaign is going. They want to check the gap after their citizens get the second booster shot, which should keep up with their target of about 6 months between the second and third doses. The following search is across the daily number of people by number of doses. The search results return a graph that looks something like this, with 3 lines for the second booster showing the gap at 5 months, 6 months, and 7 months, which shows that the community is almost keeping up with a 6-month booster gap:", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults count=5 \n | streamstats count\n |eval_time=_time-(count*3600)"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults count=5\n| streamstats count \n|eval_time=_time-(count*3600)\n|evalage =case(count=1, 25, count=2, 39, count=3, 31, count=4, 27, count=5, null())\n|evalcity =case(count=1 OR count=3,\"San Francisco\", count=2 OR count=4,\"Seattle\",count=5,\"Los Angeles\")"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_combined* | head 5 | sort _time"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_combined* | head 5 |sort _time | streamstats sum(bytes) AS ASimpleSumOfBytes BY clientip"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_combined* | head 5 |sort _time | streamstats sum(bytes) as ASimpleSumOfBytes by clientip | table _time, clientip, bytes, ASimpleSumOfBytes"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "eventtype=\"download\"| bin _time span=1d as day | stats values(clientip) as ips dc(clientip) by day | streamstats dc(ips) as\"Cumulative total\""}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... | timechart span=1h sum(bytes) as SumOfBytes | streamstats global=f sum(*) as accu_total_*"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... | timechart span=1h sum(value) as total by category | streamstats global=f | addtotals | accum Total | rename Total as accu_total"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "source=dhcp MAC=54:00:00:00:00:00 | head 10 | streamstats current=f last(DHCP_IP) as new_dhcp_ip last(_time) as time_of_change by MAC"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "source=dhcp MAC=54:00:00:00:00:00 | head 10 | streamstats current=f last(DHCP_IP) as new_dhcp_ip last(_time) as time_of_change by MAC |whereDHCP_IP!=new_dhcp_ip | convert ctime(time_of_change) as time_of_change | rename DHCP_IP as old_dhcp_ip | table time_of_change, MAC, old_dhcp_ip, new_dhcp_ip"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... | sort _time\n| streamstats time_window=153d earliest(two_doses) as two_doses_5mon\n| streamstats time_window=183d earliest(two_doses) as two_doses_6mon\n| streamstats time_window=214d earliest(two_doses) as two_doses_7mon\n| foreach two_doses_* [evalbooster_gap_<<MATCHSTR>> = <<FIELD>> - three_doses ]\n| timechart span=1d max(booster_gap_*) as booster_gap_*"}], "tables": [{"headers": ["_time", "count"], "rows": [["2020-01-09 15:35:14", "1"], ["2020-01-09 14:35:14", "2"], ["2020-01-09 13:35:14", "3"], ["2020-01-09 12:35:14", "4"], ["2020-01-09 11:35:14", "5"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "age", "city", "count"], "rows": [["2020-01-09 15:35:14", "25", "San Francisco", "1"], ["2020-01-09 14:35:14", "39", "Seattle", "2"], ["2020-01-09 13:35:14", "31", "San Francisco", "3"], ["2020-01-09 12:35:14", "27", "Seattle", "4"], ["2020-01-09 11:35:14", "", "Los Angeles", "5"]]}, {"headers": [], "rows": [["This example uses the sample data from the Search Tutorial but should work with any format of Apache web access log.

For these evaluations to work, your values need to be valid for the type of operation. For example, with the exception of addition, arithmetic operations might not produce valid results if the values are not numerical. Additionally, the search can concatenate the two operands if they are both strings. When concatenating values with a period '.' the search treats both values as strings, regardless of their actual data type. single-agg Syntax: count | <stats-func>(<field>) Description: A single aggregation applied to a single field, including an evaluated field. For <stats-func>, see Stats function options. No wildcards are allowed. The field must be specified, except when using the count function, which applies to events as a whole. split-by-clause Syntax: <field> (<tc-options>)... [<where-clause>] Description: Specifies a field to split the results by. If field is numerical, default discretization is applied. Discretization is defined with the tc-options. Use the <where-clause> to specify the number of columns to include. See the tc options and the where clause sections in this topic. Optional arguments agg=<stats-agg-term> Syntax: agg=( <stats-func> ( <evaled-field> | <wc-field> ) [AS <wc-field>] ) Description: A statistical aggregation function. See Stats function options. The function can be applied to an eval expression, or to a field or set of fields. Use the AS clause to place the result into a new field with a name that you specify. You can use wild card characters in field names. bin-options Syntax: bins | minspan | span | <start-end> | aligntime Description: Options that you can use to specify discrete bins, or groups, to organize the information. The bin-options set the maximum number of bins, not the target number of bins. See the Bin options section in this topic. Default: bins=100 cont Syntax: cont=<bool> Description: Specifies whether the chart is continuous or not. If set to true , the Search application fills in the time gaps. Default: true dedup_splitvals Syntax: dedup_splitvals=<boolean> Description: Specifies whether to remove duplicate values in multivalued <split-by-clause> fields. Default: false fixedrange Syntax: fixedrange=<bool> Description: Specifies whether or not to enforce the earliest and latest times of the search. Setting fixedrange=false allows the timechart command to constrict or expand to the time range covered by all events in the dataset. Default: true format Syntax: format=<string> Description: Used to construct output field names when multiple data series are used in conjunction with a split-by-field. format takes precedence over sep and allows you to specify a parameterized expression with the stats aggregator and function ($AGG$) and the value of the split-by-field ($VAL$). limit Syntax: limit=(top | bottom)<int> Description: Specifies a limit for the number of distinct values of the split-by field to return. If set to limit=0 , all distinct values are used. Setting limit=N or limit=topN keeps the N highest scoring distinct values of the split-by field. Setting limit=bottomN keeps the lowest scoring distinct values of the split-by field. All other values are grouped into 'OTHER', as long as useother is not set to false. The scoring is determined as follows: If a single aggregation is specified, the score is based on the sum of the values in the aggregation for that split-by value. For example, for timechart avg(host) BY <field> , the avg(host) values are added up for each value of <field> to determine the scores. If multiple aggregations are specified, the score is based on the frequency of each value of <field>. For example, for timechart avg(host) max(amount) BY <field> , the top scoring values for <field> are the most common values of <field>. Ties in scoring are broken lexicographically, based on the value of the split-by field. For example, 'AMOUNT' takes precedence over 'amount', which takes precedence over 'host'. See Usage. Default : top10 partial Syntax: partial=<bool> Description: Controls if partial time bins should be retained or not. Only the first and last bin can be partial. Default: True. Partial time bins are retained. sep Syntax: sep=<string> Description: Used to construct output field names when multiple data series are used in conjunctions with a split-by field. This is equivalent to setting format to $AGG$<sep>$VAL$. Stats function options stats-func Syntax: The syntax depends on the function that you use. See Usage. Description: Statistical functions that you can use with the timechart command. Each time you invoke the timechart command, you can use one or more functions. However, you can only use one BY clause. Bin options bins Syntax: bins=<int> Description: Sets the maximum number of bins to discretize into. This does not set the target number of bins. It finds the smallest bin size that results in no more than N distinct bins. Even though you specify a number such as 300, the resulting number of bins might be much lower. Default: 100 minspan Syntax: minspan=<span-length> Description: Specifies the smallest span granularity to use automatically inferring span from the data time range. See Usage. span Syntax: span=<log-span> | span=<span-length> | span=<snap-to-time> Description: Sets the size of each bin, using either a log-based span, a span length based on time, or a span that snaps to a specific time. For descriptions of each of these options, see Span options. The starting time of a bin might not match your local timezone. see Usage. <start-end> Syntax: end=<num> | start=<num> Description: Sets the minimum and maximum extents for numerical bins. Data outside of the [start, end] range is discarded. aligntime Syntax: aligntime=(earliest | latest | <time-specifier>) Description: Align the bin times to something other than base UNIX time (epoch 0). The aligntime option is valid only when doing a time-based discretization. Ignored if span is in days, months, or years. Span options <log-span> Syntax: [<num>]log[<num>] Description: Sets to log-based span. The first number is a coefficient. The second number is the base. If the first number is supplied, it must be a real number greater than or equal to 1.0 and less than the base. If supplied, the base must be real number greater than 1.0 and strictly greater than 1. The log-span option must come at the end of the timechart command in the search like this: <span-length> Syntax: <int>[<timescale>] Description: A span of each bin, based on time. If the timescale is provided, this is used as a time range. If not, this is an absolute bin length. <timescale> Syntax: <sec> | <min> | <hr> | <day> | <week> | <month> | <quarter> | <subseconds> Description: Timescale units. Default: <sec> <snap-to-time> Syntax: [+|-] [<time_integer>] <relative_time_unit>@<snap_to_time_unit> Description: A span of each bin, based on a relative time unit and a snap to time unit. The <snap-to-time> must include a relative_time_unit, the @ symbol, and a snap_to_time_unit. The offset, represented by the plus (+) or minus (-) is optional. If the <time_integer> is not specified, 1 is the default. For example, if you specify w as the relative_time_unit, 1 week is assumed. tc options The <tc-option> is part of the <split-by-clause>. tc-option Syntax: <bin-options> | usenull=<bool> | useother=<bool> | nullstr=<string> | otherstr=<string> Description: Timechart options for controlling the behavior of splitting by a field. bin-options See the Bin options section in this topic. nullstr Syntax: nullstr=<string> Description: If usenull=true , specifies the label for the series that is created for events that do not contain the split-by field. Default: NULL otherstr Syntax: otherstr=<string> Description: If useother=true , specifies the label for the series that is created in the table and the graph. Default: OTHER usenull Syntax: usenull=<bool> Description: Controls whether or not a series is created for events that do not contain the split-by field. The label for the series is controlled by the nullstr option. Default: true useother Syntax: useother=<bool> Description: You specify which series to include in the results table by using the <agg>, <limit>, and <where-clause> options. The useother option specifies whether to merge all of the series not included in the results table into a single new series. If useother=true , the label for the series is controlled by the otherstr option. Default: true where clause The <where-clause> is part of the <split-by-clause>. The <where-clause> is comprised of two parts, a single aggregation and some options. See Where clause examples. where clause Syntax: <single-agg> <where-comp> Description: Specifies the criteria for including particular data series when a field is given in the <tc-by-clause>. The most common use of this option is to look for spikes in your data rather than overall mass of distribution in series selection. The default value finds the top ten series by area under the curve. Alternately one could replace sum with max to find the series with the ten highest spikes. Essentially the default is the same as specifying where sum in top10. The <where-clause> has no relation to the where command. <where-comp> Syntax: <wherein-comp> | <wherethresh-comp> Description: Specify either a grouping for the series or the threshold for the series. <wherein-comp> Syntax: (in | notin) (top | bottom)<int> Description: A grouping criteria that requires the aggregated series value be in or not in some top or bottom group. <wherethresh-comp> Syntax: (< | >) [\" \"] <num> Description: A threshold criteria that requires the aggregated series value be greater than or less than some numeric threshold. You can specify the threshold with or without a space between the sign and the number.", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "...| timechart dc(data.search_props.sid) by data.search_props.type span=log2"}], "tables": [{"headers": ["Timescale", "Valid syntax", "Description"], "rows": [["<sec>", "s | sec | secs | second | seconds", "Time scale in seconds."], ["<min>", "m | min | mins | minute | minutes", "Time scale in minutes."], ["<hr>", "h | hr | hrs | hour | hours", "Time scale in hours."], ["<day>", "d | day | days", "Time scale in days."], ["<week>", "w | week | weeks", "Time scale in weeks."], ["<month>", "mon | month | months", "Time scale in months."], ["<quarter>", "q | qtr | qtrs | quarter | quarters", "Time scale in quarters."], ["<subseconds>", "us | ms | cs | ds", "Time scale in microseconds (us), milliseconds (ms), centiseconds (cs), or deciseconds (ds)"]]}], "chunk_index": 1, "total_chunks": 7, "metadata": {"title": "timechart", "section_heading": "Syntax", "section_id": "id_0ace3a15_f19d_4eb6_8207_13b892b1e200--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/search-commands/timechart", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Search Commands", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:32:39.544208+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}
{"id": "c0fe9add5f8d079b", "content": "The timechart command is a transforming command. See Command types. Note: Do not run searches that modify the _time field using eval and timechart commands with the span argument. The _time field is an internal field that should not be overwritten. See Use default fields. bins and span arguments The timechart command accepts either the bins argument OR the span argument. If you specify both bins and span , span is used. The bins argument is ignored. If you do not specify either bins or span , the timechart command uses the default bins=100. Default time spans If you use the predefined time ranges in the time range picker, and do not specify the span argument, the following table shows the default span that is used. (Thanks to Splunk users MuS and Martin Mueller for their help in compiling this default time span information.) Spans used when minspan is specified When you specify a minspan value, the span that is used for the search must be equal to or greater than one of the span threshold values in the following table. For example, if you specify minspan=15m that is equivalent to 900 seconds. The minimum span that can be used is 1800 seconds, or 30 minutes. Bin time spans and local time The span argument always rounds down the starting date for the first bin. There is no guarantee that the bin start time used by the timechart command corresponds to your local timezone. In part this is due to differences in daylight savings time for different locales. To use day boundaries, use span=1d. Do not use not span=86400s, or span=1440m, or span=24h. Bin time spans versus per_* functions The functions, per_day() , per_hour() , per_minute() , and per_second() are aggregator functions and are not responsible for setting a time span for the resultant chart. These functions are used to get a consistent scale for the data when an explicit span is not provided. The resulting span can depend on the search time range. For example, per_hour() converts the field value so that it is a rate per hour, or sum()/<hours in the span>. If your chart span ends up being 30m, it is sum()*2. If you want the span to be 1h, you still have to specify the argument span=1h in your search. Note: You can do per_hour() on one field and per_minute() (or any combination of the functions) on a different field in the same search. Subsecond bin time spans Subsecond span timescales, which are time spans that are made up of deciseconds (ds), centiseconds (cs), milliseconds (ms), or microseconds (us), should be numbers that divide evenly into a second. For example, 1s = 1000ms. This means that valid millisecond span values are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, or 500ms. In addition, span = 1000ms is not allowed. Use span = 1s instead. Split-by fields If you specify a split-by field, ensure that you specify the bins and span arguments before the split-by field. If you specify these arguments after the split-by field, Splunk software assumes that you want to control the bins on the split-by field, not on the time axis. If you use chart or timechart , you cannot use a field that you specify in a function as your split-by field as well. For example, you will not be able to run: However, you can work around this with an eval expression, for example: Prepending VALUE to the names of some fields that begin with underscore ( _ ) In timechart searches that include a split-by-clause, when search results include a field name that begins with a leading underscore ( _ ), Splunk software prepends the field name with VALUE and creates as many columns as there are unique entries in the argument of the BY clause. Prepending the string with VALUE distinguishes the field from internal fields and avoids naming a column with a leading underscore, which ensures that the field is not hidden in the output schema like most internal fields. For example, consider the following search: The results look something like this: The columns are displayed in the search results as VALUE_audit and VALUE_internal. Supported functions You can use a wide range of functions with the timechart command. For general information about using functions, see Statistical and charting functions. For a list of functions by category, see Function list by category For an alphabetical list of functions, see Alphabetical list of functions Functions and memory usage Some functions are inherently more expensive, from a memory standpoint, than other functions. For example, the distinct_count function requires far more memory than the count function. The values and list functions also can consume a lot of memory. If you are using the distinct_count function without a split-by field or with a low-cardinality split-by by field, consider replacing the distinct_count function with the the estdc function (estimated distinct count). The estdc function might result in significantly lower memory usage and run times. Lexicographical order Lexicographical order sorts items based on the values used to encode the items in computer memory. In Splunk software, this is almost always UTF-8 encoding, which is a superset of ASCII. Numbers are sorted before letters. Numbers are sorted based on the first digit. For example, the numbers 10, 9, 70, 100 are sorted lexicographically as 10, 100, 70, 9. Uppercase letters are sorted before lowercase letters. Symbols are not standard. Some symbols are sorted before numeric values. Other symbols are sorted before or after letters. You can specify a custom sort order that overrides the lexicographical order. See the blog Order Up! Custom Sort Orders. Run the timechart command in non-streaming mode when overwriting the _time field You might encounter unexpected results when you run a search that modifies the _time field with an eval command and then uses timechart with a span. To ensure that the timechart command correctly interprets the _time field after it has been overwritten by an eval command, you must force the search to run in a non-streaming mode by including the sort command before the timechart command. The sort command forces all preceding commands, including the eval that modifies _time , to complete their processing before timechart begins, which ensures that timechart operates on the final, modified _time values. For example, run the following search in Splunk Web to see this solution in action:", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "... | chart sum(A) by A span=log2"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... |evalA1=A | chart sum(A) by A1 span=log2"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "index=\"_internal\"OR index=\"_audit\"| timechart span=1m sum(linecount) by index"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "index=_internal earliest=-1m \n| head 1000 \n|eval_time = now() - (random() % (86400 * 90) ) \n| sort _time \n| timechart span=1w count"}], "tables": [{"headers": ["Time range", "Default span"], "rows": [["Last 15 minutes", "10 seconds"], ["Last 60 minutes", "1 minute"], ["Last 4 hours", "5 minutes"], ["Last 24 hours", "30 minutes"], ["Last 7 days", "1 day"], ["Last 30 days", "1 day"], ["Previous year", "1 month"]]}, {"headers": ["Span threshold", "Time equivalents"], "rows": [["1 second", ""], ["5 seconds", ""], ["10 seconds", ""], ["30 seconds", ""], ["60 seconds", "1 minute"], ["300 seconds", "5 minutes"], ["600 seconds", "10 minutes"], ["1800 seconds", "30 minutes"], ["3600 seconds", "1 hour"], ["86400 seconds", "1 day"], ["2592000 seconds", "30 days"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "VALUE_audit", "VALUE_internal"], "rows": [["2023-06-26 21:00:00", "1", "586"], ["2023-06-26 21:01:00", "1", "295"], ["2023-06-26 21:02:00", "1", "555"]]}], "chunk_index": 2, "total_chunks": 7, "metadata": {"title": "timechart", "section_heading": "Usage", "section_id": "dab97bc4_850b_476b_b4f0_dd6f613d3d09--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/search-commands/timechart", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Search Commands", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:32:39.544227+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

{"id": "5eb39a218909b83e", "content": "1. Chart revenue for the different products Chart the revenue for the different products that were purchased yesterday. This example searches for all purchase events (defined by the action=purchase ). The results are piped into timechart command. The per_hour() function sums up the values of the price field for each productName and organizes the total by time. This search produces the following table of results in the Statistics tab. To format the numbers to the proper digits for currency, click the format icon in the column heading. On the Number Formatting tab, select the Precision. Click the Visualization tab. If necessary, change the chart to a column chart. On the Format menu, the General tab contains the Stack Mode option where you can change the chart to a stacked chart. After you create this chart, you can position your mouse pointer over each section to view more metrics for the product purchased at that hour of the day. Notice that the chart does not display the data in hourly spans. Because a span is not provided (such as span=1hr), the per_hour() function converts the value so that it is a sum per hours in the time range (which in this example is 24 hours). 2. Chart daily purchases by product type Chart the number of purchases made daily for each type of product. This example searches for all purchases events, defined by the action=purchase , and pipes those results into the timechart command. The span=1day argument buckets the count of purchases over the week into daily chunks. The usenull=f argument ignore any events that contain a NULL value for categoryId. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: Click the Visualization tab. If necessary, change the chart to a column chart. Compare the number of different items purchased each day and over the course of the week. 3. Display results in 1 week intervals This search counts the number of earthquakes in Alaska where the magnitude is greater than or equal to 3.5. The results are organized in spans of 1 week, where the week begins on Monday. The <by-clause> is used to group the earthquakes by magnitude. You can only use week spans with the snap-to span argument in the timechart command. For more information, see Specify a snap to time unit. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: 4. Count the revenue for each item over time Count the total revenue made for each item sold at the shop over the last 7 days. This example shows two different searches to generate the calculations. Search 1 The first search uses the span argument to bucket the times of the search results into 1 day increments. The search then uses the sum() function to add the price for each product_name. Search 2 This second search uses the per_day() function to calculate the total of the price values for each day. Both searches produce similar results. Search 1 produces values with two decimal places. Search 2 produces values with six decimal places. The following image shows the results from Search 1. Click the Visualization tab. If necessary, change the chart to a column chart. Now you can compare the total revenue made for items purchased each day and over the course of the week. 5. Chart product views and purchases for a single day Chart a single day's views and purchases at the Buttercup Games online store. This search uses the per_hour() function and eval expressions to search for page views ( method=GET ) and purchases ( action=purchase ).

[AS <string>] Description: Either perform a basic count of a field or perform a function on a field. For a list of the supported functions for the tstats command, refer to the table below. You must specify one or more functions. You can apply the function to a field, or to a PREFIX() directive if you want to aggregate a raw segment in your indexed events as if it were an extracted field-value pair. You can also rename the result using the AS keyword, unless you are in prestats mode ( prestats=true ). You cannot specify functions without applying them to fields or eval expressions that resolve into fields. You cannot use wildcards to specify field names. See Usage to learn more about using PREFIX() , and about searches you can run to find raw segments in your data. The following table lists the supported functions by type of function. Use the links in the table to see descriptions and examples for each function. For an overview about using functions with commands, see Statistical and charting functions. Optional arguments append Syntax: append=<bool> Description: When in prestats mode ( prestats=true ), enables append=true where the prestats results append to existing results, instead of generating them. Default: false allow_old_summaries Syntax: allow_old_summaries=true | false Description: Only applies when selecting from an accelerated data model. When you change the constraints that define a data model but the Splunk software has not fully updated the summaries to reflect that change, the summaries may have some data that matches the old definition and some data that matches the new definition. To return results from summary directories only when those directories are up-to-date, set this parameter to false. If the data model definition has changed, summary directories that are older than the new definition are not used when producing output from the tstats command. This default ensures that the output from tstats always reflects your current configuration. When set to true , the tstats command uses both current summary data and summary data that was generated prior to the definition change. This is an advanced performance feature for cases where you know that the old summaries are \"good enough,\" meaning the old summary data is close enough to the new summary data that its results are reliable. See When the data model definition changes and your summaries have not been updated to match it in the Splunk Cloud Platform Knowledge Manager Manual. Default: false chunk_size Syntax: chunk_size=<unsigned_int> Description: Advanced option. This argument controls how many events are retrieved at a time from a single tsidx file when the Splunk software processes searches. Lower this setting from its default only when you find a particular tstats search is using too much memory, or when it infrequently returns events. This can happen when a search groups by excessively high-cardinality fields (fields with very large amounts of distinct values). In such situations, a lower chunk_size value can make tstats searches more responsive, but potentially slower to complete. However, a higher chunk_size can help long-running searches to complete faster, with the potential tradeoff of causing the search to be less responsive. For tstats , chunk_size cannot be set lower than 10000. Default: 10000000 (10 million) Note: The default value for the chunk_size argument is set by the chunk_size setting for the [tstats] stanza in limits.conf. If you have Splunk Cloud Platform, file a Support ticket to change this setting. fillnull_value Description: This argument sets a user-specified value that the tstats command substitutes for null values for any field within its group-by field list. Null values include field values that are missing from a subset of the returned events as well as field values that are missing from all of the returned events. If you do not provide a fillnull_value argument, tstats omits rows for events with one or more null field values from its results. Default: no default value include_reduced_buckets Syntax: include_reduced_buckets=true | false Description: This setting only applies when enableTSIDXReduction=true in indexes.conf. When set to false, the tstats command generates results only from index buckets that are not reduced. Set to true if you want tstats to use results from reduced buckets. Default: false local Syntax: local=true | false Description: If true , forces the tstats search processor to run only on the search head. This setting is useful for troubleshooting. For example, you can use it to determine whether data on a search head is or has been improperly accelerated. In systems that forward search head data to indexers, this setting may cause the search to produce few or no results. See Best practice: Forward search head data to the indexer layer in Splunk Enterprise Distributed Search. Default: false prestats Syntax: prestats=true | false Description: Specifies whether to use the prestats format. The prestats format is a Splunk internal format that is designed to be consumed by commands that generate aggregate calculations. When using the prestats format you can pipe the data into the chart , stats , or timechart commands, which are designed to accept the prestats format. When prestats=true , AS instructions are not relevant. The field names for the aggregates are determined by the command that consumes the prestats format and produces the aggregate output. prestats=true is an advanced setting. Use it only in special circumstances when you need to pass tstats-generated data directly to the chart , stats , or timechart command. Default: false summariesonly Syntax: summariesonly=<bool> Description: When summariesonly is set to false , if the time range of the tstats search exceeds the summarization range for the selected data model, the tstats command returns results for the entire time range of the search. It quickly returns results from the summarized data, and returns results more slowly from the raw, unsummarized data that exists outside of the data model summary range. If an accelerated data model is running behind in its summarization, or if its summarization searches are scheduled infrequently, setting summariesonly = false might result in a slower tstats search. This is because the data model has more unsummarized data to search through than usual. When summariesonly is set to true , the tstats search returns results only from summarized data, even when the time range of the search exceeds the summarization range of the data model. This means the search runs fast, but no unsummarized data is included in the search results. If you set summariesonly to true , the tstats won't run over unaccelerated data models. Also, when the tstats runs over accelerated data models, it returns events only from the data model's acceleration summary. You might set summariesonly = true if you need to identify the data that is currently summarized in a given data model, or if you value search efficiency over completeness of results. See Using the summariesonly argument in the Splunk Cloud Platform Knowledge Manager Manual. Default: false FROM clause arguments The FROM clause is optional. See Selecting data for more information about this clause. datamodel Syntax: datamodel=<data_model_name>.<root_dataset_name> [where nodename = <root_dataset_name>.<...>.<target_dataset_name>] Description: The name of a data model, concatenated with the name of the root dataset that you are searching. If you wish to filter on a child dataset, you need to use a where clause that uses nodename to reference a specific child dataset in a dataset hierarchy in the data model. See Selecting data for more information. WHERE clause arguments The optional WHERE clause is used as a filter. You can specify either a search or a field and a set of values with the IN operator. <search-query> Specify the search criteria to filter on. <field> IN (<value-list>) For the field , specify a list of values to include in the search results. WHERE clauses in tstat searches must contain field-value pairs that are indexed, as well as characters that are not major breakers or minor breakers. For example, consider the following search: The results look something like this: This search returns valid results because sourcetype=splunkd* is an indexed field-value pair and wildcard characters are accepted in the search criteria. The asterisk at the end of the sourcetype=splunkd* clause is treated as a wildcard, and is not regarded as either a major or minor breaker. BY clause arguments The BY clause is optional. You cannot use wildcards in the BY clause with the tstats command. See Usage. If you use the BY clause, you must specify a field-list. You can also specify a span. <field-list> Syntax: <field>, ... Description: Specify one or more fields to group results. PREFIX() Syntax: PREFIX(<string>) Description: Specify a raw segment in your indexed events that you want to split by as if it were an extracted field-value pair. See Usage for more information about the PREFIX() directive, and for a search you can run to find raw segments in your indexed data. span Syntax: span=<timespan> Description: The span of each time bin. If you use the BY clause to group by _time , use the span argument to group the time buckets. You can specify timespans such as BY _time span=1h or BY _time span=5d. If you do not specify a <timespan> , the default is auto , which means that the number of time buckets adjusts to produce a reasonable number of results. For example if initially seconds are used for the <timespan> and too many results are being returned, the <timespan> is changed to a longer value, such as minutes, to return fewer time buckets. Default: auto <timespan> Syntax: auto | <int><timescale> <timescale> Syntax: <sec> | <min> | <hr> | <day> | <month> Description: Time scale units. For the tstats command, <timescale> does not support subseconds.

{"id": "a3cd35ab6317e949", "content": "The tstats command is a report-generating command , except when prestats=true. When prestats=true , the tstats command is an event-generating command. See Command types. Generating commands use a leading pipe character and should be the first command in a search, except when prestats=true. By default, the tstats command runs over accelerated and unaccelerated data models. Properly indexed fields should appear in the fields.conf file. See Create custom fields at index time in Getting Data In. When you use a statistical function with the tstats command, you can't use an eval expression as part of the statistical function. See Complex aggregate functions. Selecting data Use the tstats command to perform statistical queries on indexed fields in tsidx files. You can select the data for the indexed fields in several ways. Indexed data Use a FROM clause to specify a data model. If you do not specify a FROM clause, the Splunk software selects from index data in the same way as the search command. You are restricted to selecting data from your allowed indexes by user role. You control exactly which indexes you select data from by using the WHERE clause. If no indexes are mentioned in the WHERE clause, the Splunk software uses the default indexes. By default, role-based search filters are applied, but can be turned off in the limits.conf file. An accelerated data model You can select data from a high-performance analytics store, which is a collection of .tsidx data summaries, for an accelerated data model. You can select data from this accelerated data model by using FROM datamodel=<data_model_name>.<root_dataset_name>. When you select a data model for a tstats search, you also have to select the root dataset within that data model that you intend to search. You cannot select all of the root datasets within a data model at once. Note: Search filters cannot be applied to accelerated data models. This includes both role-based and user-based search filters. A child dataset in an accelerated data model You can select data from a child dataset within an accelerated data model. Use a WHERE clause to specify the nodename of the child dataset. The nodename argument indicates where the target dataset is in the data model hierarchy. The syntax looks like this: ...| tstats <stats-func> FROM datamodel=<data_model_name>.<root_dataset_name> where nodename=<root_dataset_name>.<...>.<target_dataset_name> For example, say you have a data model with three root datasets, each with their own dataset hierarchies. With this hierarchy, if you wanted to run a tstats search that selects from the dataset containing records of the MechaGodzilla giant robot battles staged by the Tokyo office, you would use the following search: Note: Search filters cannot be applied to accelerated data model datasets. This includes both role-based and user-based search filters. Filtering data using the WHERE clause You can use the optional WHERE clause to filter queries with the tstats command in much the same ways as you use it with the search command. For example, WHERE supports the same time arguments, such as earliest=-1y , with the tstats command and the search command. WHERE clauses used in tstats searches can contain only indexed fields. Fields that are extracted at search time are not supported. If you don't know which of your fields are indexed, run a search on a specific index using the walklex command. Grouping data by _time You can provide any number of BY fields. If you are grouping by _time , supply a timespan with span for grouping the time buckets, for example ...BY _time span=1h or ...BY _time span=3d .", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "ButtercupGamesPromos\n     - NYC (BaseEvent)\n          - TShirtStore (NYC)\n               - FashionShows (TShirtStore)\n               - Giveaways (TShirtStore)\n     - Chicago (BaseEvent)\n          - BeerAndBrautsPopup (Chicago)\n               - BeerSales (BeerAndBrautsPopup)\n               - BrautSales (BeerAndBrautsPopup)\n     - Tokyo (BaseSearch)\n          - GiantRobotBattles (Tokyo)\n               - UFORobotGrendizer (GiantRobotBattles)\n               - MechaGodzilla (GiantRobotBattles)"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... | tstats count FROM datamodel=ButtercupGamesPromos.Tokyowherenodename=Tokyo.GiantRobotBattles.MechaGodzilla"}], "tables": [], "chunk_index": 2, "total_chunks": 7, "metadata": {"title": "tstats", "section_heading": "Usage", "section_id": "id_52cb454f_4cd6_47ef_9844_bd9dfc2860e5--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/search-commands/tstats", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Search Commands", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:32:56.935219+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}
{"id": "600663c1a0359913", "content": "Tstats and Federated Search for Splunk tstats searches that include a FROM clause are blocked for transparent mode federated searches over federated providers with Splunk Cloud Platform versions lower than 9.0.2303 or Splunk Enterprise versions lower than 9.1.0. If you use multiple transparent mode federated providers, the tstats search is processed only on federated providers with qualifying versions. For more information see About Federated Search for Splunk in Federated Search. Tstats and tsidx bucket reduction tstats searches over indexes that have undergone tsidx bucket reduction will return incorrect results. For more information see Reduce tsidx disk usage in Managing indexers and clusters of indexers. Sparkline charts You can generate sparkline charts with the tstats command only if you specify the _time field in the BY clause and use the stats command to generate the actual sparkline. For example: Multiple time ranges The tstats command is unable to handle multiple time ranges. This is because the tstats command is a generating command and doesn't perform post-search filtering, which is required to return results for multiple time ranges. The following example of a search using the tstats command on events with relative times of 5 seconds to 1 second in the past displays a warning that the results may be incorrect because the tstats command doesn't support multiple time ranges. If you want to search events in multiple time ranges, use another command such as stats , or use multiple tstats commands with append as shown in the following example. The results in this example look something like this. Wildcard characters The tstats command does not support wildcard characters in field values in aggregate functions or BY clauses. For example, you cannot specify | tstats avg(foo*) or | tstats count WHERE host=x BY source*. Aggregate functions include avg() , count() , max() , min() , and sum(). For more information, see Aggregate functions. Any results returned where the aggregate function or BY clause includes a wildcard character are only the most recent few minutes of data that has not been summarized. Include the summariesonly=t argument with your tstats command to return only summarized data. Statistical functions must have named fields With the exception of count , the tstats command supports only statistical functions that are applied to fields or eval expressions that resolve into fields. For example, you cannot specify | tstats sum or | tstats sum(). Instead the tstats syntax requires that at least one field argument be provided for the function: | tstats sum(<field>). Nested eval expressions not supported You cannot use eval expressions inside aggregate functions with the tstats command. For example, | tstats count(eval(...)) is not supported. While nested eval expressions are supported with the stats command, they are not supported with the tstats command. Complex aggregate functions The tstats command does not support complex aggregate functions such as ...count(eval('Authentication.action'==\"failure\")). Consider the following query. This query will not return accurate results because complex aggregate functions are not supported by the tstats command. Instead, separate out the aggregate functions from the eval functions, as shown in the following search. The results from this search look something like this: Limitations of CIDR matching with tstats As with the search command, you can use the tstats command to filter events with CIDR match on fields that contain IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. However, unlike the search command, the tstats command may not correctly filter strings containing non-numeric wildcard octets. As a result, your searches may return unpredictable results. If you are filtering fields with a CIDR match using the tstats command in a BY clause, you can work around this issue and correctly refilter your results by appending your search with a search command, regex command, or WHERE clause. Unfortunately, you can't use this workaround if the search doesn't include the filtered field in a BY clause. Example of using CIDR match with tstats in a BY clause Let's take a look at an example of how you could use CIDR match with the tstats command in a BY clause. Say you create a file called data.csv containing the following lines: Then follow these steps: Upload the file and set the sourcetype to csv , which ensures that all fields in the file are indexed as required by the tstats command. Run the following search against the index you specified when you uploaded the file. This example uses the main index. The results look like this: Even though only two addresses are legitimate IP addresses, all four rows of addresses are displayed in the results. Invalid IP addresses are displayed along with the valid IP addresses because the tstats command uses string matching to satisfy search requests and doesn't directly support IP address-based searches. The tstats command does its best to return the correct results for CIDR search clauses, but the tstats search may return more results than you want if the source data contains mixed IP and non-IP data such as host names. To make sure your searches only return the results you want, make sure that your data set is clean and only contains data in the correct format. If that is not possible, use the search command or WHERE clause to do post-filtering of the search results. For example, the following search using the search command displays correct results because the piped search command further filters the results from the tstats command. Alternatively, you can use the WHERE clause to filter your results, like this. Both of these searches using the search command and the WHERE clause return only the valid IP addresses in the results, which look like this: The tstats command doesn't respect the srchTimeWin parameter The tstats command doesn't respect the srchTimeWin parameter in the authorize.conf file and other role-based access controls that are intended to improve search performance. This is because the tstats command is already optimized for performance, which makes parameters like srchTimeWin irrelevant. For example, say you previously set the srchTimeWin parameter on a role for one of your users named Alex, so they are just allowed to run searches back over 1 day. You limited the search time range to prevent searches from running over longer periods of time, which could potentially impact overall system performance and slow down searches for other users. Alex has been running a stats search, but didn't notice that they were getting results for just 1 day, even though they specified 30 days. If Alex then changes their search to a tstats search, or changes their search in such a way that Splunk software automatically optimizes it to a tstats search, the 1 day setting for the srchTimeWin parameter no longer applies. As a result, Alex gets many times more results than before, since their search is returning all 30 days of events, not just 1 day of results.

{"id": "653dcd46aab2b845", "content": "Use PREFIX() to aggregate or group by raw tokens in indexed data The PREFIX() directive allows you to search on a raw segment in your indexed data as if it were an extracted field. This causes the search to run over the tsidx file in your indexers rather than the log line. This is a practice that can significantly reduce the CPU load on your indexers. The PREFIX() directive is similar to the CASE() and TERM() directives in that it matches strings in your raw data. You can use PREFIX() to locate a recurring segment in your raw event data that is actually a key-value pair separated by a delimiter that is also a minor breaker, like = or :. You give PREFIX() the text that precedes the value, which is the \"prefix\", and then the search returns the values that follow the prefix. This enables you to group by those values and aggregate them with tstats functions. The values can be strings or purely numeric. For example, say you have indexed segments in your event data that look like kbps=10 or kbps=333. You can isolate the numerical values in these segments and perform aggregations or group-by operations on them by using the PREFIX() directive to identify kbps= as a common prefix string. Run a tstats search with PREFIX(kbps=) against your event data and it will return 10 and 333. These values are perfect for tstats aggregation functions that require purely numeric input. Notice that in this example you need to include the = delimiter. If you run PREFIX(kbps) , the search returns =10 and =333. Efforts to aggregate on such results may return unexpected results, especially if you are running them through aggregation functions that require purely numeric values. Note: The text you provide for the PREFIX() directive must be in lower case. For example, the tstats search processor will fail to process PREFIX(connectionType=). Use PREFIX(connectiontype=) instead. It will still match connectionType= strings in your events. The Splunk software separates events into raw segments when it indexes data, using rules specified in segmenters.conf. You can run the following search to identify raw segments in your indexed events: Note: You cannot apply the PREFIX() directive to segment prefixes and values that contain major breakers such as spaces, square or curly brackets, parentheses, semicolons, or exclamation points. For more information about the CASE() and TERM() directives, see Use CASE() and TERM() to match phrases in the Search Manual. For more information about the segmentation of indexed events, see About event segmentation in Getting Data In For more information about minor and major breakers in segments, see Event segmentation and searching in the Search Manual. Memory and tstats search performance A pair of limits.conf settings strike a balance between the performance of tstats searches and the amount of memory they use during the search process, in RAM and on disk. If your tstats searches are consistently slow to complete you can adjust these settings to improve their performance, but at the cost of increased search-time memory usage, which can lead to search failures. If you have Splunk Cloud Platform, you need to file a Support ticket to change these settings. For more information, see Memory and stats search performance in the Search Manual. Functions and memory usage Some functions are inherently more expensive, from a memory standpoint, than other functions. For example, the distinct_count function requires far more memory than the count function. The values and list functions also can consume a lot of memory. If you are using the distinct_count function without a split-by field or with a low-cardinality split-by by field, consider replacing the distinct_count function with the estdc function (estimated distinct count). The estdc function might result in significantly lower memory usage and run times.", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "| walklex index=<target-index>type=term | stats sum(count) by term"}], "tables": [], "chunk_index": 4, "total_chunks": 7, "metadata": {"title": "tstats", "section_heading": "Performance", "section_id": "id_79890a08_37d0_45e3_b1d6_860dbf942904--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/search-commands/tstats", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Search Commands", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:32:56.935242+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

{"id": "f86a3d78bb605517", "content": "Real-time searches scan events as the events arrive for indexing. When you kick off a real-time search, Splunk software scans the incoming events. The scan looks for events that contain index-time fields that indicate the event could be a match for your search. As the real-time search runs, the software periodically evaluates the scanned events against your search criteria to find actual matches within the sliding time range window that you have defined for the search. The number of matching events can fluctuate up or down over time as the search discovers matching events at a faster or slower rate. If you are running the search in Splunk Web, the search timeline also displays the matching events that the search has returned within the chosen time range. Here is an example of a real-time search with a one minute time range window. At the point that the following screen capture was taken, the search had scanned a total of 436 events since it was launched. The matching event count of 333 represents the number of events matching the search criteria that were identified in the past minute. This number fluctuated between 312 and 357 for the following minute. If the number spiked or dropped dramatically, that could indicate that something interesting was happening that requires a closer look. As you can see, the newest events are on the right side of the timeline.

A real-time search should continue running until you or another user stops the search or deletes the search job. The real-time search should not \"time out\" for any other reason.

{"id": "15665c73d8c6e8e2", "content": "By default, when you run a real-time search, the search runs before events are indexed. Alternatively, you can configure your real-time searches to run after the events are indexed, which can greatly improve indexing performance. This is especially true if you're running a lot of concurrent real-time searches because indexed real-time search decreases the impact on the indexer. Indexed real-time search runs searches like historical searches , but also continually updates the search with new events as the events appear on disk. Use indexed real-time search when up-to-the-second accuracy is not needed. Splunk Cloud Platform For Splunk Cloud Platform on Victoria Experience, indexed real-time search is turned on. Splunk Enterprise For Splunk Enterprise, indexed real-time search is turned off by default. To turn on indexed real-time search, follow these steps. Prerequisites Only users with file system access, such as system administrators, can turn on indexed real-time search. Review the steps in How to edit a configuration file in the Admin Manual. Note: Never change or copy the configuration files in the default directory. The files in the default directory must remain intact and in their original location. Make the changes in the local directory. Steps Open the local limits.conf file for the Search app. For example, $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<app_name>/local. Under the [realtime] stanza, set indexed_realtime_use_by_default to true. Indexed real-time search and newly added search peers If your deployment includes newly added search peers and you are using indexed real-time search, all events from the new search peers show up by default in historical searches. However, existing indexed real-time searches will not pick up events from the search peers until you kick off another indexed real-time search. As a result, you should restart your indexed real-time searches every time you add new search peers. If you want to automatically pick up all events in your real-time searches after you've added new search peers to your deployment, use real-time search instead of indexed real-time search. You can do this by changing the indexed_realtime_use_by_default setting in the local limits.conf file from true back to the default, which is false. See How to edit a configuration file in the Splunk Enterprise Admin Manual. Note: Using real-time search by setting indexed_realtime_use_by_default to false makes events available to searches with lower latency, but reduces indexing throughput. About the sync delay lag time The results returned by an indexed real-time search will always lag behind a real-time search. Built into indexed real-time searches is a sync (synchronizing) delay. The sync delay is a precaution so that none of the data is missed. Indexed data does not necessarily appear on disk in the order that the data is indexed because: Multiple threads are used for indexing simultaneously The sync delay ordering that is on your operating system An indexed real-time must remember the latest indexed event that is returned for the current iteration of the time range window. That event is used as the start point for the next iteration of the time range window. If a sync delay is not imposed, some of the events before the latest event might not be searchable yet. These events are not returned during that iteration of the time range window and will never be returned. The likelihood of an unreturned event increases as the indexing and system load increases. You can control the number of seconds of sync delay lag time with the indexed_realtime_disk_sync_delay = <int> setting. By default, this delay is set to 60 seconds. The default of 60 seconds is fairly conservative. For most systems a 30 second delay will probably work successfully.

Count the number of values in a field Use the mvcount() function to count the number of values in a single value or multivalue field. In this example, mvcount() returns the number of email addresses in the To, From, and Cc fields and saves the addresses in the specified \"_count\" fields. This search takes the values in the To field and uses the split function to separate the email address on the @ symbol. The split function is also used on the Cc field for the same purpose. If only a single email address exists in the From field, as you would expect, mvcount(From) returns 1. If there is no Cc address, the Cc field might not exist for the event. In that situation mvcount(cc) returns NULL. Filter values from a multivalue field Use the mvfilter() function to filter a multivalue field using an arbitrary Boolean expression. The mvfilter function works with only one field at a time. In this example, mvfilter() keeps all of the values for the field email that end in .net or .org. Note: This example also uses the match() function to compare the pattern defined in quotes to the value of email. See Evaluation functions in the Search Reference. Return a subset of values from a multivalue field Use the mvindex() function to reference a specific value or a subset of values in a multivalue field. Since the index numbering starts at 0, if you want to reference the 3rd value of a field, you would specify it as 2.

{"id": "77351c305c660486", "content": "An eval expression is a combination of literals, fields, operators, and functions that represent the value of your destination field. The expression can involve a mathematical operation, a string concatenation, a comparison expression, a Boolean expression, or a call to one of the eval functions. eval expressions require that the field's values are valid for the type of operation. For example, with the exception of addition, arithmetic operations may not produce valid results if the values are not numerical. For addition, the eval command can concatenate the two operands if they are both strings. When concatenating values with a period (. ), the eval command treats both values as strings, regardless of their actual type. You can think of an eval expression as everything that follows the eval command, typically to the next pipe. For example, this is an eval expression: You can use eval expressions with the stats command. For example, the eval expression in this search is (eval(status=404)) , which is followed by an AS clause: Example 1: Use an eval expression with a stats function This example searches the status field which contains HTTP status codes like 200 an 404. If you run this search, it returns a total count of all events with a value in the status field. This results look something like this: You can add a BY clause to organize the count by HTTP code. This results look something like this: However, if you want the results for only one specific status, you can use an eval expression. Because the eval expression returns an evaluated field, you must use the AS keyword to specify a name for the evaluated field. This search retrieves all of the events where the sourcetype is any Apache web access log and counts the number of events where the status field value is 404. The results are placed into a field called status_count. The results look something like this: You can arrange the results based on another field using a BY clause. The results look something like this: Example 2: Define a field that is the sum of the areas of two circles Use the eval command to define a field that is the sum of the areas of two circles, A and B. The area of circle is πr^2 , where r is the radius. For circles A and B, the radii are radius_a and radius_b, respectively. This eval expression uses the pi and pow functions to calculate the area of each circle, then adds them together and saves the result in a field named sum_of_areas. Example 3: Define a location field using the city and state fields Use the eval command to define a location field using the city and state fields. For example, if the city=Philadelphia and state=PA, you can define a new field called location where location=Philadelphia, PA. This eval expression is a simple string concatenation. Example 4: Use eval functions to classify where an email came from This example classifies where an email came from based on the email address domain. The .com, .net, and .org addresses are considered local , while anything else is considered abroad. There are many domain names. Of course, domains that are not .com, .net, or .org are not necessarily from abroad. This is just an example. The eval command in this search contains multiple expressions, separated by commas. The first half of this search is similar to previous example. The split() function is used to break up the email address in the mailfrom field. The mvindex function defines the from_domain as the portion of the mailfrom field after the @ symbol. Then, the if() and match() functions are used. If the from_domain value ends with a .com, .net., or .org , the location field is assigned the value local. If from_domain does not match .com, .net, or .org , the location field is assigned the value abroad. The results are then piped into the stats command to count the number of results for each location value. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: Note: This example merely illustrates using the match() function.

Note: When troubleshooting search performance, it's important to understand the difference between the scanCount and resultCount costs. For dense searches, the scanCount and resultCount are similar ( scanCount = resultCount ); and for sparse searches, the scanCount is much greater than the result count ( scanCount > resultCount ). Search performance should not so much be measured using the resultCount /time rate but scanCount /time instead. Typically, the scanCount /second event rate should hover between 10k and 20k events per second for performance to be deemed good.

Because field discovery for events is turned off, the Fast mode doesn't perform any search-time field extraction. However, the Fast mode does return search-time fields that you explicitly add to the search. Since the Fast mode is optimized for speed, there might be disparities in values of fields compared to the Smart or Verbose modes. But, the number of results returned in searches using the Fast mode are consistent with the number of results returned by the other modes. The Fast mode does the following: Extracts default fields such as host , source , and sourcetype. The fast mode only returns information on indexed and default fields, and any search-time extracted fields that you explicitly include in your search. If you're searching on specific indexed fields, those fields are also extracted. For searches with transforming commands , depicts search results by displaying a visualization, such as a chart. For searches that don't include transforming commands, displays event lists and event timelines. Most of the time, your ad hoc searches should use the Smart mode, but there are certain specific cases where it makes sense to use the Fast mode instead. For example, use the Fast mode in the following situations: When you need to do basic field discovery and you don't care about the accuracy of your field extractions. For example, perhaps you just want to see what is in a particular source type, source, or host field. When you don't know what's in your index. For example, perhaps you want to know what indexed fields are in your index. When you want to know how many events are in your index and how frequently they occur in your data. For example, perhaps you want to find out the volume of events and approximately how many events you're getting during a particular slice of time, such as 500,000 events in a day. When you want to run reporting searches that include transforming commands that return results in charts or visualizations.

You can create a time range based on an existing time range, or you can hide time ranges. Create a time range based on an existing time range The easiest way to create a new time range is to use an existing time range as the basis for a new time range. For example, the Relative time range list contains the Last 15 minutes time range. You want to create a time range for the last 30 minutes. You start by creating a duplicate, or clone, of the Last 15 minutes time range. In the clone, you change the Earliest setting from -15min to -30min. From the Settings menu, under the Knowledge list select User interface. In the User Interface window, select Time ranges. Locate the time range that you want to use. In the Actions column click Clone. A copy of the specifications for the time range appear. Make the changes to the time range specifications and click Save. The new time range appears in the Relative list in the Presets menu. Create a new Preset time range You can create a new time range for the Presets menu. For example, you want to create a time range that shows searches yesterday from the hours of 12:00 to 15:00. You need to specify relative times in the Earliest and Latest fields. In the Earliest field you specify -1d@d+12h. In the Latest field you specify -1d@d+15h. From the Settings menu, under the Knowledge list select User interface. In the User Interface window, select Time ranges. Click New. Complete the fields in the Add New window and click Save. The new time range appears in the Relative list in the Presets menu. Hide a time range on the Presets list From the Settings menu, under the Knowledge list select User interface. In the User Interface window, select Time ranges. Locate the time range you want to hide.

Transactions also have additional data that is stored in the fields: duration and transactiontype. duration contains the duration of the transaction (the difference between the timestamps of the first and last events of the transaction). transactiontype is the name of the transaction (as defined in transactiontypes.conf by the transaction's stanza name). You can add transaction to any search. For best search performance, craft your search and then pipe it to the transaction command. For more information see the topic on the transaction command in the Search Reference manual. Follow the transaction command with the following options. Note: Some transaction command options do not work in conjunction with other options. name=<transaction-name> Specifies the name of a stanza from transactiontypes.conf. Use this to invoke a transaction type that you have already configured for reuse. If other arguments are provided, they overule values specified for the same arguments in the transaction rule.

Events with common field names and different values will not be grouped. For example, if you add ...| transaction host , then a search result that has host=mylaptop can never be in the same transaction as a search result with host=myserver. A search result that has no host value can be in a transaction with a result that has host=mylaptop. match=closest Specify the matching type to use with a transaction definition. The only value supported currently is closest. maxspan=[<integer>s | m | h | d] Set the maximum duration of one transaction. Can be in seconds, minutes, hours or days. For example: 5s, 6m, 12h or 30d. Defaults to maxspan=-1 , for an \"all time\" timerange. maxpause=[<integer> s|m|h|d] Specifies the maximum pause between transactions. Requires there be no pause between the events within the transaction greater than maxpause. If the value is negative, the maxspause constraint is turned off. Defaults to maxpause=-1. startswith=<string> A search or eval-filtering expression which, if satisfied by an event, marks the beginning of a new transaction.

{"id": "e69373809fb22c8d", "content": "Both the stats command and the transaction command are similar in that they enable you to aggregate individual events together based on field values. The stats command is meant to calculate statistics on events grouped by one or more fields and discard the events (unless you are using eventstats or streamstats ). On the other hand, except for the duration between first and last events and the count of events, the transaction command does not compute statistics over the grouped events. Additionally, it retains the raw event and other field values from the original event and enables you to group events using much more complex criteria, such as limiting the grouping by time span or delays and requiring terms to define the start or end of a group. The transaction command is most useful in two specific cases: 1. When a unique ID (from one or more fields) alone is not sufficient to discriminate between two transactions. This is the case when the identifier is reused, for example web sessions identified by cookie or client IP. In this case, time spans or pauses are also used to segment the data into transactions. In other cases, when an identifier is reused, for example in DHCP logs, a particular message may identify the beginning or end of a transaction. 2. When it is desirable to see the raw text of the events combined rather than an analysis on the constituent fields of the events. In other cases, it's usually better to use the stats command, which performs more efficiently, especially in a distributed environment. Often there is a unique ID in the events and you can use the stats command. For example, to compute the statistics on the duration of trades identified by the unique ID trade_id , the following searches will yield the same answer: and If however, the trade_id values are reused but each trade ends with some text, such as \"END\", the only solution is to use this transaction search: On the other hand, if trade_id values are reused, but not within a 10 minute duration, the solution is to use the following transaction search: Read more about \"About event grouping and correlation\" in an earlier chapter in this manual.", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "... | transaction trade_id | chart count by duration span=log2"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... | stats range(_time) as duration by trade_id | chart count by duration span=log2"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... | transaction trade_id endswith=END | chart count by duration span=log2"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... | transaction trade_id maxpause=10m | chart count by duration span=log2"}], "tables": [], "chunk_index": 2, "total_chunks": 4, "metadata": {"title": "About transactions", "section_heading": "Using stats instead of transaction", "section_id": "fcbc549f_5395_455e_8cdc_085a0ee6db93--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/search-manual/10.2/group-and-correlate-events/about-transactions", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > Search Manual > Group and Correlate Events", "manual": "search-manual", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:40:29.672586+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

{"id": "51527965dd18d07c", "content": "A subsearch is a search within a primary, or outer, search. When a search contains a subsearch, the subsearch typically runs first. Subsearches must be enclosed in square brackets in the primary search. Consider the following search. The subsearch portion of the search is enclosed in square brackets. The first command in a subsearch must be a generating command , such as search , eventcount , inputlookup , and tstats. For a list of generating commands, see Command types in the Search Reference. One exception is the foreach command, which accepts a subsearch that does not begin with a generating command, such as eval. Note: When a search contains a subsearch, the Splunk software processes the subsearch first as a distinct search job. Then it runs the search that contains it as another search job. Keep this in mind if you include subsearches in searches that are run frequently and you are concerned about search concurrency issues or excess load on your search scheduler. How subsearches work A subsearch looks for a single piece of information that is then added as a criteria, or argument, to the primary search. You use a subsearch because the single piece of information that you are looking for is dynamic. The single piece of information might change every time you run the subsearch. For example, you want to return all of the events from the host that was the most active in the last hour. The host that was the most active might be different from hour to hour. You need to identify the most active host before you can return the events from that host. Break this search down into two parts. The most active host in the last hour. This is the subsearch. The events from that host. This is the primary search. You could run two searches to obtain the list of events. The following search identifies the most active host in the last hour. This search returns only one host value. Assume that the result is the host named crashy. To return all of the events from the host crashy , you need to run a second search. The drawback to running two searches is that you cannot set up reports and dashboard panels to run automatically. You must run the first search to identify the piece of information that you need, and then run the second search with that piece of information. You can combine these two searches into one search that includes a subsearch. The subsearch is in square brackets and is run first. The subsearch in this example identifies the most active host in the last hour. The result of the subsearch is then provided as a criteria for the main search. The main search returns the events for the host. Note: By default, subsearches return a maximum of 10,000 results and have a maximum runtime of 60 seconds. If a subsearch runs for more than 60 seconds, its search results are automatically finalized. Time ranges and subsearches Time ranges selected from the Time Range Picker apply to the base search and to subsearches. However, time ranges specified directly in the base search do not apply to subsearches. Likewise, a time range specified directly in a subsearch applies only to that subsearch. The time range does not apply to the base search or any other subsearch. For example, if the Time Range Picker is set to Last 7 days and a subsearch contains earliest=2d@d , then the earliest time modifier applies only to the subsearch and Last 7 days applies to the base search. When to use subsearches Subsearches are mainly used for two purposes: Parameterize one search, using the output of another search. The previous example of searching for the most active host in the last hour is an example of this use of a subsearch. Run a separate search and add the output to the first search using the append command. A subsearch can be used only where the explicit action that you are trying to accomplish is with the search and not a transformation of the data. For example, you cannot use a subsearch with \" sourcetype=top | multikv \", because the multikv command does not expect a subsearch as an argument. Certain commands, such as append and join can accept a subsearch as an argument. Multiple subsearches in a search string You can use more than one subsearch in a search. If a search has a set of nested subsearches, the inner most subsearch is run first, followed by the next inner subsearch, working out to the outermost subsearch and then the primary search. For example, you have the following search. Note: You must have a command after the pipe and before the subsearch. In this example, the search command is used for the second and third subsearches. The first subsearch is used as a predicate to the main search. The order in which this search is processed is: |search [search index=* | stats by ipaddress] |search [search index=* | stats count by user] [search index=* | stats count by component] (An implied search command) index=* OR index=_* (and the results of the nested subsearches) Here is another example. Be certain to analyze your search syntax when you find yourself using subsearches frequently. It is often possible to rewrite the search and omit the subsearch. If the subsearches are sequential instead of nested, the subsearch farthest to the left, or beginning of the search, is run first. Then working towards the right, or end of the search, the next subsearch is run. When all of the subsearches are run, then the primary search is run. For example, you have the following search. The order in which the search is processes is: search index=* | stats by customerID search index=* | stats count by productName (An implied search command) index=* OR index=_* (the results of the subsearches) Initiating subsearches with search commands A subsearch can be initiated through a search command such as the map command. For example, consider the following search: The map command runs a subsearch for the option search=\"search index=* OR index=_* earliest=0 latest=now\". Other commands that can run a subsearch include search , join and union. These commands can start one or more subsearches. What's more, each subsearch, not the command itself, is limited by the maxtime setting in the limits.conf file, which specifies the maximum number of seconds that a subsearch can run before finalizing. In our example, the maxtime setting limits the runtime of the subsearch and is applied to the subsearch, not the map command. However, the subsearch may stop at the map command.", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_* status=200 action=purchase [search sourcetype=access_* status=200 action=purchase | toplimit=1 clientip | table clientip] | stats count, dc(productId), values(productId) by clientip"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "[search sourcetype=access_* status=200 action=purchase | toplimit=1 clientip | table clientip]"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=syslog earliest=-1h | toplimit=1 host | fields host"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=syslog host=crashy"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=syslog  [search sourcetype=syslog earliest=-1h | toplimit=1 host | fields + host]"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "index=* OR index=_* \n[search index=* | stats count by component \n| search [search index=* | stats count by user \n| search [search index=* | stats by ipaddress]]]"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "index=foo error [ search index=bar baz [search index=* | stats count by user | search count>100] | stats count by host ]"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "index=* OR index=_* | [search index=* | stats count by customerID] | [search index=* | stats by productName]"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "|makeresults \n|map search=\"search index=* OR index=_* earliest=0 latest=now\""}], "tables": [], "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 4, "metadata": {"title": "About subsearches", "section_heading": "Using subsearches", "section_id": "id_32e73a62_0f81_4c89_a099_f2556fe612ed--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/search-manual/10.2/subsearches/about-subsearches", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > Search Manual > Subsearches", "manual": "search-manual", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:40:46.819764+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}
{"id": "b63922d087879eb9", "content": "These examples show you the difference between searching your data with and without a subsearch. Example 1: Without a subsearch, find what the most frequent shopper purchased You want to find the single most frequent shopper on the Buttercup Games online store and what that shopper has purchased. Use the top command to return the most frequent shopper. To find the shopper who accessed the online shop the most, use this search. The limit=1 argument specifies to return 1 value. The clientip argument specifies the field to return. This search returns one clientip value, 87.194.216.51, which you will use to identify the VIP shopper. You now need to run another search to determine how many different products the VIP shopper has purchased. Use the stats command to count the purchases by this VIP customer. This search uses the count() function to return the total count of the purchases for the VIP shopper. The dc() function is the distinct_count function. Use this function to count the number of different, or unique, products that the shopper bought. The values function is used to display the distinct product IDs as a multivalue field. The drawback to this approach is that you have to run two searches each time you want to build this table. The top purchaser is not likely to be the same person at any given time range. Example 2: Using a subsearch, find what the most frequent shopper purchased Let's start with our first requirement, to identify the single most frequent shopper on the Buttercup Games online store. Copy and paste the following search into the Search bar and run the search. Make sure the time range is All time. This search returns the clientip for the most frequent shopper, clientip=87.194.216.51. This search is almost identical to the search in Example 1 Step 1. The difference is the last piped command, | table clientip , which displays the clientip information in a table. To find what this shopper has purchased, you run a search on the same data. You provide the result of the most frequent shopper search as one of the criteria for the purchases search. The most frequent shopper search becomes the subsearch for the purchases search. The purchases search is referred to as the outer or primary search. Because you are searching the same data, the beginning of the outer search is identical to the beginning of the subsearch. A subsearch is enclosed in square brackets [ ] and processed first when the search is parsed. Copy and paste the following search into the Search bar and run the search. Because the top command returns the count and percent fields, the table command is used to keep only the clientip value. These results should match the result of the two searches in Example 1, if you run it on the same time range. If you change the time range, you might see different results because the top purchasing customer will be different. Note: The performance of this subsearch depends on how many distinct IP addresses match status=200 action=purchase. If there are thousands of distinct IP addresses, the top command has to keep track of all of those addresses before the top 1 is returned, impacting performance. By default, subsearches return a maximum of 10,000 results and have a maximum runtime of 60 seconds. In large production environments, it is possible that the subsearch in this example will timeout before it completes. The best option is to rewrite the query to limit the number of events that the subsearch must process. Alternatively, you can increase the maximum results and maximum runtime parameters. For more information about these options, see About performance considerations. Subsearches and long complex searches can be difficult to read. You can apply auto-formatting to the search syntax to make the the search syntax easier to read in the Search bar. Use the following keyboard shortcut to apply auto-formatting to a search. On Linux or Windows use Ctrl + \\. On Mac OSX use Command + \\. You can also use Command + Shift + F , which works well with many non-English keyboards. You can make the information more understandable by renaming the columns. You rename columns by using the AS operator on the fields in your search. If the rename that you want to use contains a space, you must enclose the rename in quotation marks.

If you are a Splunk Enterprise administrator, you can use these values when you edit the times.conf file (to add options to the time range picker), to specify the earliest/latest time ranges in the saved search dialog, or when you use the REST API to access the Splunk search engine. When you use time range windows with real-time searches, some of the events that occur within the latest second may not be displayed. This is expected behavior and is due to the latency between the timestamps within the events and the time when the event arrives. Because the time range window is with respect to the timestamps within the events and not the time when the event arrives, events that arrive after the time window won't display.", "code_examples": [], "tables": [], "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 4, "metadata": {"title": "Specify time ranges for real-time searches", "section_heading": "Real-time modifier syntax", "section_id": "id_2ed201db_68a8_4d50_81e4_35797acb81f7--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/search-manual/10.2/specify-time-ranges/specify-time-ranges-for-real-time-searches", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > Search Manual > Specify Time Ranges", "manual": "search-manual", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:41:20.599934+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

In \"all-time\" real-time searches, the window spans all of your events, so events do not disappear once they appear in the window, but events that are newer than the time the search job was created can appear in the window as they occur.

The eventstats command computes the same statistics as the stats command, but it also aggregates the results to the original raw data. When you run the following search, it returns an events list instead of a results table, because the eventstats command does not change the raw data. You can use the table command to format the results as a table that displays the fields you want. With the table command you can view the values of the bytes field, or any of the original fields in your raw events. The streamstats command also aggregates the calculated statistics to the original raw event, but it does this at the time the event is seen. To demonstrate this, include the _time field in the earlier search and use the streamstats command. Instead of a total sum for each clientip , which is what the stats and eventstats commands return, this search calculates a sum for each event based on the time that it is seen.

{"id": "e3529b1b40b25379", "content": "The Splunk search language includes two forecasting commands: predict and x11. The predict command enables you to use different forecasting algorithms to predict future values of single and multivalue fields. The x11 command, which is named after the X11 algorithm, removes seasonal fluctuations in fields to expose the real trend in your underlying data series. Forecasting algorithms You can select from the following algorithms with the predict command: LL, LLP, LLT, LLB, and LLP5. Each of these algorithms are variations of the Kalman filter. For more information, see the predict command in the Search Reference. Forecasting seasonality with the x11 command The seasonal component of your time-series data is either additive or multiplicative, which is reflected in the two types of seasonality that you can calculate with the x11 command: add() for additive and mult() for multiplicative. How do you know which type of seasonality to adjust from your data? The best way to describe the difference between an additive and a multiplicative seasonal component is with an example: The annual sales of flowers will peak on and around certain days of the year, such as Valentine's Day and Mother's Day. During Valentine's Day, the sale of roses might increase by X dollars every year. This dollar amount is independent of the normal level of the series, and you can add X dollars to your forecasts for Valentine's Day every year, making this time series a candidate for an additive seasonal adjustment. In an additive seasonal adjustment, each value of a time series is adjusted by adding or subtracting a quantity that represents the absolute amount by which that value differs from normal in that season. Alternatively, in a multiplicative seasonal component, the seasonal effect expresses itself in percentage terms. The absolute magnitude of the seasonal variations increases as the series grows over time. For example, the number of roses sold during Valentine's Day might increase by 40% or a factor of 1.4. When the sales of roses is generally weak, the absolute (dollar) increase in Valentine's Day sales will also be relatively weak. However, the percentage will be constant. And, if the sales of roses are strong, then the absolute (dollar) increase will be proportionately greater. In a multiplicative seasonal adjustment, this pattern is removed by dividing each value of the time series by a quantity that represents the percentage from normal or divided by a factor that is typically observed in that season. When plotted on a chart, these two types of seasonal components show distinguishing characteristics: The additive seasonal series shows steady seasonal fluctuations, regardless of the overall level of the series. The multiplicative seasonal series shows varying size of seasonal fluctuations that depend on the overall level of the series.

{"id": "c56d166d27e9c114", "content": "You always use the sparklines feature in conjunction with chart and stats searches, because it is a function of those two search commands. It is not a command by itself. The functionality of sparklines is the same for both search commands. Sparklines are not available as a dashboard chart visualization by themselves, but you can set up a dashboard panel with a table visualization that displays sparklines. For more information, see the Visualization reference topic in the Splunk Data Visualizations Manual. For more information about the chart and stats commands, including details on the syntax around the sparkline function, see chart and stats in the Search Reference. Example: Stats, sparklines, and earthquake data Here are some examples of stats searches that use sparklines to provide additional information about earthquake data. Let's say you want to use the USGS Earthquakes data to show the locations that had the most earthquakes over the past month, a column that shows the average quake magnitude for each location. You could use the following search: This search returns the following table, with sparklines that illustrate the quake count over the course of the month for each of the top earthquake locations: Right away you can see differences in quake distribution between the different locations. You can click on a sourceLocation to see the actual events that are included in the location calculations. For the avg(mag) column, you can use the Format icon to change the number formatting in that column. You can easily get the minimum and maximum count for a particular region by mousing over the sparkline; in this example you can see that in Southern Alaska, the minimum count of quakes experienced in a single day during the 7-day period was 1, while the maximum count per day was 6. But what if you want your sparkline to represent not only the earthquake count, but also the relative average magnitude of the quakes affecting each region? In other words, how can you make the sparkline line chart represent average quake magnitude for each \"time bucket\" (segment) of the chart? Try a search like this: This search produces a sparkline for each region that shows the average quake magnitude for the quake events that fall into each segment of the sparkline. By specifying a dash ( - ) after sort , the results are sorted in descending order. But it does a bit more than that. It also asks that the sparkline divide itself up into smaller chunks of time. The preceding table had a sparkline that was divided up by day, so each data point in the sparkline represented an event count for a full 24 hour period. This is why those sparklines were so short.

See Index time versus search time in the Managing Indexers and Clusters manual. Field extraction at index time At index time , Splunk software extracts a small set of fields. This set of fields includes default fields , custom indexed fields, and fields indexed from structured data. Default fields exist in all events. Three important default fields are host, source, and source type. They describe where the event originated. Other default fields include datetime fields, which provide additional searchable granularity to event timestamps. Splunk software also automatically adds default fields classified as internal fields. Custom indexed fields are fields that you have manually configured for index-time extraction. See Create custom fields at index time in the Getting Data In manual. Finally, when Splunk software indexes structured data, it creates index-time field extractions for the fields that it finds. Examples of structured data include: comma-separated value files (CSV) tab-separated value files (TSV) pipe-separated value files JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data sources When searching for default field values and custom indexed field values you can use the standard <field>=<value> syntax. This syntax matches default fields, custom indexed fields, and search-time fields. However if you are searching specifically for a field that has been extracted at index-time from structured data, you can search more efficiently if you exchange the equal sign for a double colon, as follows: This syntax works best in searches for fields that were indexed from structured data.

In this example, host is a default field, while eventtype and user are additional fields that might have been automatically extracted or that you defined. In general, an event type is a user-defined field that simplifies search by letting you categorize events. You can save a search as an event type and quickly retrieve those events using the eventtype field. For more information, read About event types in the Knowledge Manager Manual. Example 2: Search for events from the source \"/var/www/log/php_error.log\". The source of an event is the name of the file, stream, or other input from which the event originates. Example 3: Search for all events that have an Apache web access source type. The source type of an event is the format of the data input from which it originates. In this search uses a wildcard to match any Apache web access log that begins with \"access_\". This includes access_common and access_combined (and you might also see access_combined_wcookie). Example 4: Search indexed information from various CSV files to get a list of Plano-based employees. You have indexed several CSV files of employee records. Each of these CSV files share the same fields. You want to search for the employees from these files that are affiliated with the office in Plano, Texas. This example uses the <field>::<value> syntax to find the fields from those CSV files, which are extracted at index time. This syntax works best for fields extracted from indexed structured data, although it can handle other kinds of index time fields as well. It cannot find fields that are extracted at search time. Example 5: Search corp1 for events that have more than 4 lines, and omit events that contain the term 400. You can use comparison expressions to match field/value pairs. Comparison expressions with \"=\" and \"!=\" work with all field/value pairs. Comparison expressions with < > <= >= work only with fields that have numeric values. This example specifies a search for events that have more than 4 lines, linecount>4. Example 6: Searching with the Boolean \"NOT\" versus the comparison operator \"!=\" is not the same. The following search returns events where field is undefined (or NULL). The following search returns events where field exists and does not have the value \"value\".

{"id": "8520345817313465", "content": "You use the mcollect command to convert events into metric data points to be stored in a metric index on the search head. The metrics data uses a specific format for the metrics fields. See Metrics data format in Metrics. CAUTION: The mcollect command causes new data to be written to a metric index for every run of the search. Note: All metrics search commands are case sensitive. This means, for example, that mcollect treats as the following as three distinct values of metric_name : cap.gear , CAP.GEAR , and Cap.Gear. The Splunk platform cannot index metric data points that contain metric_name fields which are empty or composed entirely of white spaces. If you are upgrading to version 8.0.0 After you upgrade your search head and indexer clusters to version 8.0.x of Splunk Enterprise, edit limits.conf on each search head cluster and set the always_use_single_value_output setting under the [mcollect] stanza to false. This lets these nodes use the \"multiple measures per metric data point\" schema when you convert logs to metrics with the mcollect command or use metrics rollups. This schema increases your data storage capacity and improves metrics search performance. How to use the split argument The split argument determines how mcollect identifies the measurement fields in your search. It defaults to false. When split=false , your search needs to explicitly identify its measurement fields. If necessary it can use rename or eval conversions to do this. If you have single-metric events, your mcollect search must produce results with a metric_name field that provides the name of the measure, and a _value field that provides the measure's numeric value. If you have multiple-metric events, your mcollect search must produce results that follow this syntax: metric_name:<metric_name>=<numeric_value>. mcollect treats each of these fields as a measurement. mcollect treats the remaining fields as dimensions. When you set split=true , you use field-list to identify the dimensions in your search. mcollect converts any field that is not in the field-list into a measurement. The only exceptions are internal fields beginning with an underscore and the prefix_field , if you have set one. When you set split=allnums , mcollect treats all numeric fields as metric measures and all non-numeric fields as dimensions. You can optionally use field-list to declare that mcollect should treat certain numeric fields in the events as dimensions. Set a prefix field Use the prefix_field argument to apply a prefix to the metric fields in your event data. For example, if you have the following data: type=cpu usage=0.78 idle=0.22 You have two metric fields, usage and idle. Say you include the following in an mcollect search of that data: Because you have set split = true the Splunk software automatically converts those fields into measures, because they are not otherwise identified in a <field-list>. Then it applies the value of the specified prefix_field as a prefix to the metric field names. In this case, because you have specified the type field as the prefix field, its value, cpu , becomes the metric name prefix. The results look like this: Time If the _time field is present in the results, the Splunk software uses it as the timestamp of the metric data point. If the _time field is not present, the current time is used. field-list If field-list is not specified, mcollect treats all fields as dimensions for the metric data points it generates, except for the prefix_field and internal fields (fields with an underscore '_' prefix). If field-list is specified, the list must appear at the end of the mcollect command arguments. If field-list is specified, all fields are treated as metric values, except for the fields in field-list , the prefix-field , and internal fields. The name of each metric value is the field name prefixed with the prefix_field value. Effectively, one metric data point is returned for each qualifying field that contains a numerical value.

The single value version of the field is a flat string that is separated by a space or by the delimiter that you specify with the delim argument.

In the typeahead stanza, set banned_segments to the string that you want filtered out as the prefix in typeahead searches. The impact of typeahead on search results The typeahead command returns the most common terms found in indexed data with the given prefix. If you use the typeahead command with the default settings, the command may not return all search results or the correct search results in the following cases: The time to complete the search takes longer than the value specified by the max_time argument, which is 1 second, by default. Data is indexed on a server that is not randomly chosen, resulting in the exclusion of its data from the search results. This can happen when the value of max_server is less than the number of indexers, for example, if max_server is set to the default, which is 2 , but there are actually 3 indexers. In addition, the typeahead command may not return all of the search results if the count argument is set lower than the actual number of results. For example, if the count argument is set to 10 , the typeahead command returns only the top 10 results, even though more results could actually be returned. Set the number of additional search peers used in a typeahead job The max_servers argument is designed to minimize the workload impact of running typeahead search jobs in an indexer clustering environment. For load balancing, the selection of additional search peers for typeahead is random. A setting of 0 removes all limits, causing all available search peers to be used for typeahead search jobs. The default for the max_servers argument is controlled by the max_servers setting in limits.conf. Typeahead and .conf file updates The typeahead command uses a cache to run fast searches at the expense of accurate results. As a result, sometimes what is in the cache and shows up in typeahead search results may not reflect recent changes to .conf files. This is because it takes 5 or 10 minutes for the cached data to clear, depending on the performance of the server. For example, if you rename a sourcetype in the props.conf file, it may take a few minutes for that change to display in typeahead search results. A typeahead search that is run while the cache is being cleared returns the cached data, which is expected behavior. If you make a change to a .conf file, you can wait a few minutes for the cache to clear to get the most accurate and up-to-date results from your typeahead search. Alternatively, you can turn off the use_cache argument to clear the cache immediately, which fetches more accurate results, but is a little slower. After you manually clear the cache, you should see the changes to your .conf file reflected in your results when you rerun the typeahead search.

The Splunk software ships with a copy of the dbip-city-lite.mmdb IP geolocation database file. This file is located in the $SPLUNK_HOME/share/ directory. Updating the IP geolocation database file Through Splunk Web, you can update the .mmdb file that ships with the Splunk software. The file you update it with can be a copy of one of the following two files. Only those two files are supported. To use these two files, you must have a license for the GeoIP2 City database. Note: Replacing your mmdb file with one of these two files reintroduces the Timezone field that is absent in the default .mmdb file, but does not reintroduce the MetroCode field. Prerequisites You must have a role with the upload_mmdb_files capability. Steps Go online and find a download page for the binary .tar.gz versions of the GeoLite2-City or the GeoIP2-City database files. Download the binary .tar.gz version of the file (GeoLite2-City or GeoIP2-City) that is most appropriate for your needs. Expand the binary .tar.gz version of the file. The .tar.gz file expands into a folder which contains the GeoLite2-City.mmdb file, or the GeoIP2-City.mmdb file, depending on the download you selected. In Splunk Web, go to Settings > Lookups > GeoIP lookups file. On the GeoIP lookups file page, click Choose file. Select the .mmdb file. Click Save. The page displays a success message when the upload completes. An .mmdb file that you upload through this method is treated as a lookup table by the Splunk software. This means it is picked up by knowledge bundle replication in distributed search environments, but that also means it can increase the size of knowledge bundles. See Knowledge bundle replication overview in the Distributed Search manual. Note: If you upload your own .mmdb file in Splunk Web and later decide you want to revert back to the .mmdb file that was shipped with the Splunk software, go to Settings > Lookups > GeoIP lookups file and delete your uploaded file. Impact of upgrading Splunk software When you upgrade your Splunk platform, the .mmdb file in the $SPLUNK_HOME/share/ directory is replaced by the version of the file that ships with the Splunk software. You can avoid this by storing the .mmdb file in a different file path. Storing the .mmdb file in a different file path To store the GeoLite2-City.mmdb or GeoIP2-City.mmdb file in a different file path you must update the path directly in the limits.conf file. This is not possible in Splunk Cloud Platform, only Splunk Enterprise. Note: The Splunk Web .mmdb file upload feature takes precedence over manual updates to the .mmdb file path in limits.conf. Prerequisites Only users with file system access, such as system administrators, can specify a different file path to the .mmdb file in the limits.conf file. Review the steps in How to edit a configuration file in the Admin Manual. You can have configuration files with the same name in your default, local, and app directories. Read Where you can place (or find) your modified configuration files in the Admin Manual. Note: Never change or copy the configuration files in the default directory. The files in the default directory must remain intact and in their original location. Make the changes in the local directory. Steps Open the local limits.conf file for the Search app. For example, $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/search/local. Add the [iplocation] stanza. Add the db_path setting and specify the absolute path to the .mmdb file. The db_path setting does not support standard Splunk environment variables such as $SPLUNK_HOME. For example: db_path = /Applications/Splunk/mmdb/GeoLite2-City.mmdb specifies a new directory called mmdb. Ensure a copy of the .mmdb file is stored in the ../Applications/Splunk/mmdb/ directory. Because you are editing the path to the .mmdb file, you should restart the Splunk server. Storing the .mmdb file with a different name Alternatively, you can add the updated .mmdb to the $SPLUNK_HOME/share/ directory using a different name and then specify that name in the db_path setting. For example: db_path = /Applications/Splunk/share/GeoLite2-City_paid.mmdb. The .mmdb file and distributed deployments The iplocation command is a distributable streaming command , which means that it can be processed on the indexers. The $SPLUNK_HOME/share/ directory is not part of the knowledge bundle. If you update the .mmdb file in the $SPLUNK_HOME/share/ directory, the updated file is not automatically sent to the indexers in a distributed deployment.

Your role must have the appropriate capabilities to access the internal indexes. This search takes advantage of what Splunk software logs about its operation in the _internal index. It returns all logs where the log_level is DEBUG, WARN, ERROR, FATAL and clusters them together. Then it sorts the clusters by the count of events in each cluster. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: Example 2 Search for events that don't cluster into large groups. This returns clusters of events and uses the sort command to display them in ascending order based on the cluster size, which are the values of cluster_count. Because they don't cluster into large groups, you can consider these rare or uncommon events. Example 3 Cluster similar error events together and search for the most frequent type of error. This searches your index for events that include the term \"error\" and clusters them together if they are similar. The sort command is used to display the events in descending order based on the cluster size, cluster_count , so that largest clusters are shown first. The head command is then used to show the twenty largest clusters. Now that you've found the most common types of errors in your data, you can dig deeper to find the root causes of these errors. Example 4 Use the cluster command to see an overview of your data. If you have a large volume of data, run the following search over a small time range, such as 15 minutes or 1 hour, or restrict it to a source type or index. This search helps you to learn more about your data by grouping events together based on their similarity and showing you a few of events from each cluster. It uses labelonly=t to keep each event in the cluster and append them with a cluster_label. The sort command is used to show the results in descending order by its size ( cluster_count ), then its cluster_label , then the indexed timestamp of the event ( _time ).

Location path omitted When used with no path argument, the spath command runs in \"auto-extract\" mode. By default, when the spath command is in \"auto-extract\" mode, it finds and extracts all the fields from the first 5,000 characters in the input field. These fields default to _raw if another input source is not specified. If a path is provided, the value of this path is extracted to a field named by the path or to a field specified by the output argument, if the output argument is provided. A location path contains one or more location steps A location path contains one or more location steps, each of which has a context that is specified by the location steps that precede it. The context for the top-level location step is implicitly the top-level node of the entire XML or JSON document. The location step is composed of a field name and an optional array index The location step is composed of a field name and an optional array index indicated by curly brackets around an integer or a string. Array indices mean different things in XML and JSON. For example, JSON uses zero-based indexing. In JSON, product.desc{3} refers to the fourth element of the desc child of the product element. In XML, this same path refers to the third desc child of product. Using wildcards in place of an array index The spath command lets you use wildcards to take the place of an array index in JSON. Now, you can use the location path entities.hashtags{}.text to get the text for all of the hashtags, as opposed to specifying entities.hashtags{0}.text , entities.hashtags{1}.text , and so on. The referenced path, here entities.hashtags , has to refer to an array for this to make sense. Otherwise, you get an error just like with regular array indices. This also works with XML. For example, catalog.book and catalog.book{} are equivalent. Both get you all the books in the catalog. Overriding the spath extraction character limit By default, the spath command extracts all the fields from the first 5,000 characters in the input field. If your events are longer than 5,000 characters and you want to extract all of the fields, you can override the extraction character limit for all searches that use the spath command. To change this character limit for all spath searches, change the extraction_cutoff setting in the limits.conf file to a larger value. If you change the default extraction_cutoff setting, you must also change the setting to the same value in all limits.conf files across all search head and indexer tiers. Splunk Cloud Platform To change the limits.conf extraction_cutoff setting, use one of the following methods: The Configure limits page in Splunk Web. For more information, see Configure limits using Splunk Web in the Splunk Cloud Platform Admin Manual. The Admin Config Service (ACS) command line interface (CLI). For more information, see Administer Splunk Cloud Platform using the ACS CLI in the Splunk Cloud Platform Admin Config Service Manual. The Admin Config Service (ACS) API. For more information, see Manage limits.conf configurations in Splunk Cloud Platform in the Splunk Cloud Platform Admin Config Service Manual. Splunk Enterprise To change the extraction_cutoff setting, follow these steps. Prerequisites Only users with file system access, such as system administrators, can edit configuration files. Review the steps in How to edit a configuration file in the Splunk Enterprise Admin Manual. CAUTION: Never change or copy the configuration files in the default directory. The files in the default directory must remain intact and in their original location. Make changes to the files in the local directory. Steps Open or create a local limits.conf file at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local if you are using *nix, or %SPLUNK_HOME%\\etc\\system\\local if you are using Windows. In the [spath] stanza, add the line extraction_cutoff = <value> set to the value you want as the extraction cutoff. If your deployment includes search head or indexer clusters, repeat the previous steps on every indexer peer node or search head cluster member. See Use the deployer to distribute apps and configuration updates in Splunk Enterprise Distributed Search and Update common peer configurations and apps in Splunk Enterprise Managing Indexers and Clusters of Indexers for information about changing the limits.conf setting across search head and indexer clusters. JSON data used with the spath command must be well-formed To use the spath command to extract JSON data, ensure that the JSON data is well-formed.

Because no path argument is specified, the spath command runs in \"auto-extract\" mode and extracts all of the fields from the first 5,000 characters in the input field. The fields are then renamed and placed in a table. Then, use the eval function, mvzip(), to create a new multivalued field named x, with the values of the size and data: Now, use the mvexpand command to create individual events based on x and the eval function mvindex() to redefine the values for data and size.

Optional arguments field-list Syntax: <field> ... Description: One or more field names. The events are grouped into transactions, based on the unique values in the fields. For example, suppose two fields are specified: client_ip and host. For each client_ip value, a separate transaction is returned for each unique host value for that client_ip. memcontrol-options Syntax: <maxopentxn> | <maxopenevents> | <keepevicted> Description: These options control the memory usage for your transactions. They are not required, but you can use 0 or more of the options to define your transaction. See Memory control options. name Syntax: name=<transaction-name> Description: Specify the stanza name of a transaction that is configured in the transactiontypes.conf file. This runs the search using the settings defined in this stanza of the configuration file. If you provide other transaction definition options (such as maxpause) in this search, they overrule the settings in the configuration file. rendering-options Syntax: <delim> | <mvlist> | <mvraw> | <nullstr> Description: These options control the multivalue rendering for your transactions. They are not required, but you can use 0 or more of the options to define your transaction. See Multivalue rendering options. txn_definition-options Syntax: <maxspan> | <maxpause> | <maxevents> | <startswith> | <endswith> | <connected> | <unifyends> | <keeporphans> Description: Specify the transaction definition options to define your transactions. You can use multiple options to define your transaction. Txn definition options connected Syntax: connected=<bool> Description: Only relevant if a field or fields list is specified. If an event contains fields required by the transaction, but none of these fields have been instantiated in the transaction (added with a previous event), this opens a new transaction (connected=true) or adds the event to the transaction (connected=false). If the default value for this argument is changed, the default for the unifyends argument will also change to the same value. For example, if connected=false , then unifyends=false. Default: true endswith Syntax: endswith=<filter-string> Description: A search or eval expression which, if satisfied by an event, marks the end of a transaction. keeporphans Syntax: keeporphans=true | false Description: Specify whether the transaction command should output the results that are not part of any transactions. The results that are passed through as \"orphans\" are distinguished from transaction events with a _txn_orphan field, which has a value of 1 for orphan results. Default: false maxspan Syntax: maxspan=<int>[s | m | h | d] Description: Specifies the maximum length of time in seconds, minutes, hours, or days that the events can span, which is the maximum total time between the earliest and latest events in a transaction. The events in the transaction must span less than the integer specified for maxspan. Events that exceed the maxspan limit are treated as part of a separate transaction. If the value is negative, the maxspan constraint is deactivated and there is no limit. Events must be sorted in descending chronological order before the maxspan argument is used. See the related example later in this topic. Default: -1 (no limit) maxpause Syntax: maxpause=<int>[s | m | h | d] Description: Specifies the maximum length of time in seconds, minutes, hours, or days for the pause between consecutive events in a transaction, which is the maximum total time between events. If the value is negative, the maxpause constraint is deactivated and there is no limit. Events must be sorted in descending chronological order before the maxpause argument is used. See the related example later in this topic. Default: -1 (no limit) maxevents Syntax: maxevents=<int> Description: The maximum number of events in a transaction.

The default value for this argument is the same as the connected argument. For example, if connected=false , then unifyends=false. Default: true, set to the same default value as the connected argument Filter string options These options are used with the startswith and endswith arguments. <filter-string> Syntax: <search-expression> | (<quoted-search-expression>) | eval(<eval-expression>) Description: A search or eval filtering expression which if satisfied by an event marks the end of a transaction. <search-expression> Description: A valid search expression that does not contain quotes. <quoted-search-expression> Description: A valid search expression that contains quotes. <eval-expression> Description: A valid eval expression that evaluates to a Boolean. Memory control options If you have Splunk Cloud Platform, Splunk Support administers these settings in the limits.conf file on your behalf. keepevicted Syntax: keepevicted=<bool> Description: Whether to output evicted transactions. Evicted transactions can be distinguished from non-evicted transactions by checking the value of the closed_txn field. The closed_txn field is set to 0 , or false, for evicted transactions and 1 , or true for non-evicted, or closed, transactions. The closed_txn field is set to 1 if one of the following conditions is specified: maxevents , maxspan , maxpause , startswith. For startswith , because the transaction command sees events in reverse chronological order, it closes a transaction when it satisfies the start condition. If none of these conditions is specified, all transactions are output even though all transactions will have closed_txn set to 0. A transaction can also be evicted when the memory limitations are reached. Default: false or 0 maxopenevents Syntax: maxopenevents=<int> Description: Specifies the maximum number of events (which are) part of open transactions before transaction eviction starts happening, using LRU policy. Default: The default value for this argument is read from the transactions stanza in the limits.conf file. maxopentxn Syntax: maxopentxn=<int> Description: Specifies the maximum number of not yet closed transactions to keep in the open pool before starting to evict transactions, using LRU policy. Default: The default value for this argument is read from the transactions stanza in the limits.conf file. Multivalue rendering options delim Syntax: delim=<string> Description: Specify a character to separate multiple values. When used in conjunction with the mvraw=t argument, represents a string used to delimit the values in the _raw field. Default: \" \" (whitespace) mvlist Syntax: mvlist= true | false | <field-list> Description: Flag that controls how multivalued fields are processed. When set to mvlist=true , the multivalued fields in the transaction are a list of the original events ordered in arrival order. When set to mvlist=false , the multivalued fields in the transaction are a set of unique field values ordered alphabetically. If a comma or space delimited list of fields is provided, only those fields are rendered as lists. Default: false mvraw Syntax: mvraw=<bool> Description: Used to specify whether the _raw field of the transaction search result should be a multivalued field.

{"id": "7dc4e7ecd508fe78", "content": "1. Transactions of Web access events based on IP address Define a transaction based on Web access events that share the same IP address. The first and last events in the transaction should be no more than thirty seconds apart and each event should not be longer than five seconds apart. This produces the following events list. The clientip for each event in the transaction is highlighted. This search groups events together based on the IP addresses accessing the server and the time constraints. The search results might have multiple values for some fields, such as host and source. For example, requests from a single IP could come from multiple hosts if multiple people are shopping from the same office. For more information, read the topic About transactions in the Knowledge Manager Manual. 2. Transaction of Web access events based on host and client IP Define a transaction based on Web access events that have a unique combination of host and clientip values. The first and last events in the transaction should be no more than thirty seconds apart and each event should not be longer than five seconds apart. This search produces the following events list. Each of these events have a distinct combination of the IP address ( clientip ) values and host values within the limits of the time constraints specified in the search. 3. Purchase transactions based on IP address and time range This search defines a purchase transaction as 3 events from one IP address which occur in a 10 minute span of time. This search defines a purchase event based on Web access events that have the action=purchase value. These results are then piped into the transaction command. This search identifies purchase transactions by events that share the same clientip , where each session lasts no longer than 10 minutes, and includes no more than 3 events. This search produces the following events list: 4. Email transactions based on maxevents and endswith This example defines an email transaction as a group of up to 10 events. Each event contains the same value for the mid (message ID), icid (incoming connection ID), and dcid (delivery connection ID). The last event in the transaction contains a Message done string. This search produces the following list of events: By default, only the first 5 events in a transaction are shown. The first transaction contains 7 events and the last event is hidden. The second and third transactions show the Message done string in the last event in the transaction. 5. Email transactions based on maxevents, maxspan, and mvlist This example defines an email transaction as a group of up to 10 events. Each event contains the same value for the mid (message ID), icid (incoming connection ID), and dcid (delivery connection ID). The first and last events in the transaction should be no more than thirty seconds apart. By default, the values of multivalue fields are suppressed in search results with the default setting for mvlist , which is false. Specifying mvlist=true in this search displays all of the values of the selected fields. This produces the following events list: Here you can see that each transaction has a duration that is less than thirty seconds. Also, if there is more than one value for a field, each of the values is listed. 6. Transactions with the same session ID and IP address Define a transaction as a group of events that have the same session ID, JSESSIONID , and come from the same IP address, clientip , and where the first event contains the string, \"view\", and the last event contains the string, \"purchase\". The search defines the first event in the transaction as events that include the string, \"view\", using the startswith=\"view\" argument. The endswith=\"purchase\" argument does the same for the last event in the transaction. This example then pipes the transactions into the where command and the duration field to filter out all of the transactions that took less than a second to complete. The where filter cannot be applied before the transaction command because the duration field is added by the transaction command. You might be curious about why the transactions took a long time, so viewing these events might help you to troubleshoot. You won't see it in this data, but some transactions might take a long time because the user is updating and removing items from their shopping cart before they completes the purchase. Additionally, this search is run over all events. There is no filtering before the transaction command. Anytime you can filter the search before the first pipe, the faster the search runs. 7. Sort order when using maxspan and maxpause Pay careful attention to the sort order of your events when using the maxspan and maxpause arguments with the transaction command because searches with events sorted in ascending chronological order return incorrect results. For example, the following search returns expected results because the search uses | sort -_time to sort events in descending chronological order before the maxspan argument is used: The results look like this: In contrast, the following search doesn't generate the correct results because events are sorted in ascending chronological order by default before the maxspan argument is used: The results look like this:", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_* | transaction clientip maxspan=30s maxpause=5s"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_* | transaction clientip host maxspan=30s maxpause=5s"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_* action=purchase | transaction clientip maxspan=10m maxevents=3"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=\"cisco:esa\"| transaction mid dcid icid maxevents=10 endswith=\"Message done\""}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=\"cisco:esa\"| transaction mid dcid icid maxevents=10 maxspan=30s mvlist=true"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "sourcetype=access_* | transaction JSESSIONID clientip startswith=\"view\"endswith=\"purchase\"|whereduration>0"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "|makeresults count=10\n|streamstats count\n|eval_time=now()+10*count, user=\"nobody\"|sort -_time\n|transaction user maxspan=11s"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "|makeresults count=20\n|streamstats count\n|eval_time=now()+10*count, user=\"nobody\"|transaction user maxspan=11s"}], "tables": [{"headers": [], "rows": [["This example uses the sample data from the Search Tutorial but should work with any format of Apache web access log.

{"id": "2a5f51159e75cd33", "content": "The set command is an event-generating command. See Command types. Generating commands use a leading pipe character and should be the first command in a search. Results The set command considers results to be the same if all of fields that the results contain match. Some internal fields generated by the search, such as _serial, vary from search to search. You need to filter out some of the fields if you are using the set command with raw events, as opposed to transformed results such as those from a stats command. Typically in these cases, all fields are the same from search to search. Output limitations There is a limit on the quantity of results that come out of the invoked subsearches that the set command receives to operate on. If this limit is exceeded, the input result set to the diff command is silently truncated. If you have Splunk Enterprise, you can adjust this limit by editing the limits.conf file and changing the maxout value in the [subsearch] stanza. If this value is altered, the default quantity of results coming from a variety of subsearch scenarios are altered. Note that very large values might cause extensive stalls during the 'parsing' phase of a search, which is when subsearches run. The default value for this limit is 10000. Note: Only users with file system access, such as system administrators, can edit the configuration files. Never change or copy the configuration files in the default directory. The files in the default directory must remain intact and in their original location. Make the changes in the local directory. See How to edit a configuration file. If you have Splunk Cloud Platform and want to edit a configuration file, file a Support ticket. Result rows limitations By default the set command attempts to traverse a maximum of 50000 items from each subsearch. If the number of input results from either search exceeds this limit, the set command silently ignores the remaining events. By default, the maxout setting for subsearches in limits.conf prevents the number of results from exceeding this limit. This maximum is controlled by the maxresultrows setting in the [set] stanza in the limits.conf file. Increasing this limit can result in more memory usage.

{"id": "2c6de7e37d137dab", "content": "The rename command is a distributable streaming command. See Command types. Rename with a phrase Use quotation marks when you rename a field with a phrase. Rename multiple, similarly named fields Use wildcards to rename multiple fields with similar names. For example, suppose you have the following field names: EU_UK EU_DE EU_PL You can rename the fields to replace EU with EMEA: The results show these field names: EMEA_UK EMEA_DE EMEA_PL Both the original and renamed fields must include the same number of wildcards, otherwise a wildcard mismatch error is returned. See Examples. You can't rename one field with multiple names You can't rename one field with multiple names. For example if you have field A, you can't specify | rename A as B, A as C. This rule also applies to other commands where you can rename fields, such as the stats command. The following example is not valid: You can't merge multiple fields into one field You can't use the rename command to merge multiple fields into one field because null, or non-present, fields are brought along with the values. For example, if you have events with either product_id or pid fields, ... | rename pid AS product_id would not merge the pid values into the product_id field. It overwrites product_id with Null values where pid does not exist for the event. See the eval command and coalesce() function. You can't match wildcard characters while renaming fields You can use the asterisk ( * ) in your searches as a wildcard character, but you can't use a backslash ( \\ ) to escape an asterisk in search strings. A backslash \\ and an asterisk * match the characters \\* in searches, not an escaped wildcard character. Because the Splunk platform doesn't support escaping wildcards, asterisk ( * ) characters in field names in rename searches can't be matched and replaced. Renaming a field that does not exist Renaming a field can cause loss of data. Suppose you rename fieldA to fieldB, but fieldA does not exist. If fieldB does not exist, nothing happens. If fieldB does exist, the result of the rename is that the data in fieldB is removed. The data in fieldB will contain null values. The original and new field names must have the same number of wildcards The number of asterisks ( * ) in the original name must match the number of asterisks in the new name. For example, the following search fails because there is one wildcard character in the original name, but none in the name that replaces it: The following search completes successfully because the number of wildcard characters in both names is the same. Support for backslash characters ( \\ ) in the rename command To match a backslash character ( \\ ) in a field name when using the rename command, use 2 backslashes for each backslash in the original field name.

Optional arguments chunk_size Syntax: chunk_size=<unsigned-integer> Description: Advanced option. This argument controls how many metric time series are retrieved at a time from a single time-series index file ( .tsidx file) when the Splunk software processes searches. Lower this setting from its default only when you find a particular mpreview search is using too much memory, or when it infrequently returns events. This can happen when a search groups by excessively high-cardinality dimensions (dimensions with very large amounts of distinct values). In such situations, a lower chunk_size value can make mpreview searches more responsive, but potentially slower to complete. A higher chunk_size , on the other hand, can help long-running searches to complete faster, with the potential tradeoff of causing the search to be less responsive. For mpreview , chunk_size cannot be set lower than 10. For more information about this setting, see Use chunk_size to regulate mpreview performance. Default: 1000 Note: For Splunk Enterprise: The default value for the the chunk_size argument is set by the chunk_size setting for the [msearch] stanza in limits.conf. earliest Syntax: earliest=<time-specifier> Description: Specify the earliest _time for the time range of your search. You can specify the time in the following formats: Exact time (in ISO8601 format). For example, earliest=\"2023-09-05T11:52:43-05:00\" or earliest=\"2023-09-05T11:52:43.123-05:00\". Relative time. For example, earliest=-h or earliest=@w0. UNIX time. For example, earliest=1696812434. For more information about setting exact times see Date and time format variables. For more information about setting relative times, see Time modifiers. Subsecond options are available only if you are searching over a metrics index with millisecond timestamp resolution. filter Syntax: filter= \"<string>\" Description: An arbitrary boolean expression over the dimension or metric_name. index-opt Syntax: index=<index-name> (index=<index-name>)... Description: Limits the search to results from one or more indexes. You can use wildcard characters (*). To match non-internal indexes, use index=*. To match internal indexes, use index=_*. latest Syntax: latest=<time-specifier> Description: Specify the latest time for the _time range of your search. You can specify the time in the following formats: Exact time (in ISO8601 format). For example, latest=\"2023-09-12T11:52:43-05:00\" or earliest=\"2023-09-12T11:52:43.123-05:00\". Relative time. For example, latest=-30m or latest=@w6. UNIX time. For example, latest=1699490848. For more information about setting exact times see Date and time format variables. For more information about setting relative times, see Time modifiers. Subsecond options are available only if you are searching over a metrics index with millisecond timestamp resolution. splunk_server Syntax: splunk_server=<wc-string> Description: Specifies the distributed search peer from which to return results. If you are using Splunk Enterprise, you can specify only one splunk_server argument. However, you can use a wildcard when you specify the server name to indicate multiple servers. For example, you can specify splunk_server=peer01 or splunk_server=peer*. Use local to refer to the search head. splunk_server_group Syntax: splunk_server_group=<wc-string> Description: Limits the results to one or more server groups. If you are using Splunk Cloud Platform, omit this parameter. You can specify a wildcard character in the string to indicate multiple server groups. target_per_timeseries Syntax: target_per_timeseries=<unsigned-integer> Description Determines the target number of metric data points to retrieve per metric time series from each metrics time-series index file ( .tsidx file) associated with the mpreview search. If a time series has less than the target_per_timeseries of data points within a .tsidx file, the search head retrieves all of the data points for that time series within that particular .tsidx file. CAUTION: If you set target_per_timeseries to 0 it returns all data points available within the given time range for each time series. This search will likely be very large in scale and therefore very slow to complete. If you must search on a large number of metric data points, use mstats instead. For more information about this setting, see How the target_per_timeseries argument works. Default: 5 Note: The default value for the the target_per_timeseries argument is set by the target_per_timeseries setting for the [msearch] stanza in limits.conf", "code_examples": [], "tables": [], "chunk_index": 1, "total_chunks": 5, "metadata": {"title": "mpreview", "section_heading": "Syntax", "section_id": "id_66a013ed_608f_4a38_a8a9_5d4c26731326--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/search-commands/mpreview", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Search Commands", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:51:11.966047+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}
{"id": "27fd12aeebffce2b", "content": "This search command generates a list of individual metric data points from a specified metric index that match a provided filter. The filter can be any arbitrary boolean expression over the dimensions or the metric_name. Specify earliest and latest to override the time range picker settings. For more information about setting earliest and latest , see Time modifiers. The mpreview command is designed to display individual metric data points in JSON format. If you want to aggregate metric data points, use the mstats command. Note: All metrics search commands are case sensitive. This means, for example, that mpreview treats as the following as three distinct values of metric_name : cap.gear , CAP.GEAR , and Cap.Gear. How the target_per_timeseries argument works Unfiltered mpreview searches can cover extremely large numbers of raw metric data points. In some cases the sheer number of data points covered by the search can cause such searches to be slow or unresponsive. The target_per_timeseries argument makes the mpreview command more responsive while giving you a relatively broad preview of your metric data. It limits the number of metric data points that mpreview can return from each metric time series in each .tsidx file covered by the search. For example, if you have 10 metrics tsidx files that each contain 100 metric time series, and each time series has >=5 data points. If you set target_per_timeseries=5 in the search, you should expect a maximum of 10 x 100 x 5 = 5000 metric data points to be returned by the search. On the other hand, say you have 10 metrics tsidx files that each contain 100 metric time series, but in this case, 50 of those time series have 3 data points and the other 50 of those time series have >=5 data points. If you set target_per_timeseries=5 in the search, you should expect to get 10 x ((50 x 3) + (50 x 5)) = 4000 data points. Note: The target_per_timeseries argument is especially useful when the number of metric data points covered by your mpreview search is significantly larger than the number of metric time series covered by the search. It's not particularly helpful if the number of data points in your search are slightly larger than or equal to the number of metric time series in the search. You can run this search to determine the number of metric data points that could potentially be covered by an mpreview search: You can run this search to determine the number of metric time series that could potentially be covered by an mpreview search: Use chunk_size to regulate mpreview performance If you find that mpreview is slow or unresponsive despite the target_per_timeseries argument you can also use chunk_size to regulate mpreview behavior.

Transforming commands, such as stats and chart , do not pass the _raw field to the next command in the pipeline. Boolean expressions The order in which Boolean expressions are evaluated with the search command is: Expressions within parentheses NOT clauses OR clauses AND clauses This evaluation order is different than the order used with the eval and where commands, which evaluate AND before OR clauses. The search command doesn't support XOR. See Boolean expressions with logical operators in the Splunk platform Search Manual. Comparing two fields To compare two fields, do not specify index=myindex fieldA=fieldB or index=myindex fieldA!=fieldB with the search command. When specifying a comparison_expression, the search command expects a <field> compared with a <value>. The search command interprets fieldB as the value, and not as the name of a field. Use the where command to compare two fields. For not equal comparisons, you can specify the criteria in several ways. or See Difference between NOT and != in the Search Manual. Filter using the IN operator Use the IN operator when you want to determine if a field contains one of several values. For example, use this syntax: Instead of this syntax: When used with the search command, you can use a wildcard character ( * ) in the list of values for the IN operator. For example: You can use the NOT operator with the IN operator. For example: There is also an IN function that you can use with the eval and where commands. Wild card characters are not allowed in the values list when the IN function is used with the eval and where commands. See Comparison and Conditional functions. CIDR matching The search command can perform a CIDR match on a field that contains IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Suppose the ip field contains these values: 10.10.10.12 50.10.10.17 10.10.10.23 If you specify ip=\"10.10.10.0/24\" , the search returns the events with the first and last values: 10.10.10.12 and 10.10.10.23. Lexicographical order Lexicographical order sorts items based on the values used to encode the items in computer memory. In Splunk software, this is almost always UTF-8 encoding, which is a superset of ASCII. Numbers are sorted before letters. Numbers are sorted based on the first digit. For example, the numbers 10, 9, 70, 100 are sorted lexicographically as 10, 100, 70, 9. Uppercase letters are sorted before lowercase letters. Symbols are not standard. Some symbols are sorted before numeric values. Other symbols are sorted before or after letters. You can specify a custom sort order that overrides the lexicographical order. See the blog Order Up! Custom Sort Orders. Quotes and escaping characters In general, you need quotation marks around phrases and field values that include white spaces, commas, pipes, quotations, and brackets. Quotation marks must be balanced. An opening quotation must be followed by an unescaped closing quotation. For example: A search such as error | stats count will find the number of events containing the string error. A search such as ... | search \"error | stats count\" would return the raw events containing error, a pipe, stats, and count, in that order. Additionally, use quotation marks around keywords and phrases if you don't want to search for their default meaning, such as Boolean operators and field/value pairs. For example: A search for the keyword AND without meaning the Boolean operator: error \"AND\" A search for this field/value phrase: error \"startswith=foo\" The backslash character (&nbsp\\&nbsp) is used to escape quotes, pipes, and the backslash character itself. Backslash escape sequences are expanded inside quotation marks. For example: The sequence \\| as part of a search sends a pipe character to the command, instead of using the pipe as a split between commands. The sequence \\\" sends a literal quotation mark to the command. For example, this is useful if you want to search for a literal quotation mark or insert a literal quotation mark into a field using regular expressions. The \\\\ sequence sends a literal backslash to the command. Unrecognized backslash sequences are not altered: For example, \\s in a search string is available as \\s to the command, because \\s is not a known escape sequence. However, the search string \\\\s is available as \\s to the command, because \\\\ is a known escape sequence that is converted to \\. See Backslashes in the Search Manual. Search with TERM() You can use the TERM() directive to force Splunk software to match whatever is inside the parentheses as a single term in the index. TERM is more useful when the term contains minor segmenters, such as periods, and is bounded by major segmenters, such as spaces or commas. In fact, TERM does not work for terms that are not bounded by major breakers. See Use CASE and TERM to match phrases in the Search Manual. Search with CASE() You can use the CASE() directive to search for terms and field values that are case-sensitive. See Use CASE and TERM to match phrases in the Search Manual .", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "index=myindex |wherefieldA=fieldB"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "index=myindex |wherefieldA!=fieldB"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "index=myindex |whereNOT fieldA=fieldB"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... error_code IN (400, 402, 404, 500) | ..."}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... error_code=400 OR error_code=402 OR error_code=404 OR error_code=500 | ..."}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... error_code IN (40*, 500) | ..."}, {"language": "spl", "code": "...

{"id": "7101e2428758e790", "content": "These examples demonstrate how to use the search command. You can find more examples in the Start Searching topic of the Search Tutorial. 1. Field-value pair matching This example demonstrates field-value pair matching for specific values of source IP (src) and destination IP (dst). 2. Using boolean and comparison operators This example demonstrates field-value pair matching with boolean and comparison operators. Search for events with code values of either 10 or 29, and any host that isn't \"localhost\", and an xqp value that is greater than 5. In this example you could also use the IN operator since you are specifying two field-value pairs on the same field. The revised search is: 3. Using wildcards This example demonstrates field-value pair matching with wildcards. Search for events from all the web servers that have an HTTP client or server error status. In this example you could also use the IN operator since you are specifying two field-value pairs on the same field. The revised search is: 4. Using the IN operator This example shows how to use the IN operator to specify a list of field-value pair matchings. In the events from an access.log file, search the action field for the values addtocart or purchase. 5. Specifying a secondary search This example uses the search command twice. The search command is implied at the beginning of every search with the criteria eventtype=web-traffic. The search command is used again later in the search pipeline to filter out the results. This search defines a web session using the transaction command and searches for the user sessions that contain more than three events. 6. Using the NOT or != comparisons Searching with the boolean \"NOT\"comparison operator is not the same as using the \"!=\" comparison. The following search returns everything except fieldA=\"value2\", including all other fields. The following search returns events where fieldA exists and does not have the value \"value2\". If you use a wildcard for the value, NOT fieldA=* returns events where fieldA is null or undefined, and fieldA!=* never returns any events. See Difference between NOT and != in the Search Manual. 7. Using search to perform CIDR matching You can use the search command to match IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and subnets that use CIDR notation. For example, this search identifies whether the specified IPv4 address is located in the subnet. The IP address is located in the subnet, so search displays it in the search results, which look like this. Note that you can get identical results using the eval command with the cidrmatch(\"X\",Y) function, as shown in this example. Alternatively, if you're using IPv6 addresses, you can use the search command to identify whether the specified IPv6 address is located in the subnet. The IP address is in the subnet, so the search results look like this.

Build a contingency table of recent data You want to build a contingency table to look at the relationship between the magnitudes and depths of recent earthquakes. You start with a simple search. There are quite a range of values for the Magnitude and Depth fields, which results in a very large table. The magnitude values appear in the first column. The depth values appear in the first row. The list is sorted by magnitude. The results appear on the Statistics tab. The following table shows only a small portion of the table of results returned from the search. As you can see, earthquakes can have negative magnitudes. Only where an earthquake occurred that matches the magnitude and depth will a count appear in the table. To build a more usable contingency table, you should reformat the values for the magnitude and depth fields. Group the magnitudes and depths into ranges. This search uses the eval command with the case() function to redefine the values of Magnitude and Depth, bucketing them into a range of values. For example, the Depth values are redefined as \"Shallow\", \"Mid\", or \"Deep\". Use the sort command to sort the results by magnitude. Otherwise the results are sorted by the row totals. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: There were a lot of quakes in this month. Do higher magnitude earthquakes have a greater depth than lower magnitude earthquakes? Not really. The table shows that the majority of the recent earthquakes in all of magnitude ranges were shallow. There are significantly fewer earthquakes in the mid-to-deep range.

See the arg-options section for the descriptions for each option. arg-options addinfo Syntax: addinfo=<bool> Description: Use this option to specify whether to prefix search time and time-range information fields on to each summary index event. If set to true , adds fields to each event in the following format: info_min_time=<search_earliest_time>, info_max_time=<search_latest_time>, info_search_time=<search_exec_time> Default: True when summary events are destined for an events index or when output_format=raw. False when summary events are destined for a metrics index. addtime Syntax: addtime=<bool> Description: Use this option to specify whether to prefix a time field on to each event. Some commands return results that do not have a _raw field, such as the stats , chart , timechart commands. If you specify addtime=false , the Splunk software uses its generic date detection against fields in whatever order they happen to be in the summary rows. If you specify addtime=true , the Splunk software uses the search time range info_min_time. This time range is added by the sistats command or _time. Splunk software adds the time field based on the first field that it finds: info_min_time , _time , or now(). This option is not valid when output_format=hec. Default: True when summary events are destined for an events index. False when summary events are destined for a metrics index. file Syntax: file=<string> Description: The file name where you want the events to be written. You can use a timestamp or a random number for the file name by specifying either file=$timestamp$ or file=$random$. Usage: \".stash\" needs to be added at the end of the file name when used with \"index=\". Otherwise, the data is added to the main index. Default: <random-number>_events.stash host Syntax: host=<string> Description: The name of the host that you want to specify for the events. This option is not valid when output_format=hec. marker Syntax: marker=<string> Description: A string, usually of key-value pairs, to append to each event written out. Each key-value pair must be separated by a comma and a space. If the value contains spaces or commas, it must be escape quoted. For example if the key-value pair is search_name=vpn starts and stops , you must change it to search_name=\\\"vpn starts and stops\\\". This option is not valid when output_format=hec. output_format Syntax: output_format=[raw | hec] Description: Specifies the output format for the summary indexing. If set to raw , uses the traditional non-structured log style summary indexing stash output format. If set to hec , the collect command generates HTTP Event Collector (HEC) JSON formatted output. By default, license usage is not counted in the following cases: When output_format=raw and the source type is the internal stash source type ( stash ). When output_format=hec and the source type is the internal stash source type ( stash_hec ). To confirm whether the source type is stash or stash_hec , expand the event in the search results after you run your search. License usage is counted when output_format=hec and the original source type is used instead of stash_hec. When using output_format=hec , note that: All fields are automatically indexed when the stash file is indexed. The file that is written to the var/spool/splunk path ends in .stash_hec instead of .stash. The source, source type, and host from the original data are used directly in the summary index. These fields are not remapped to the extract_host/extracted_sourcetype/... path. The index and splunk_server fields in the original data are ignored. You can't use the addtime , host , marker , source , sourcetype , or uselb options. Default: raw run_in_preview Syntax: run_in_preview=<bool> Description: Controls whether the collect command is enabled during preview generation. Generally, you do not want to insert preview results into the summary index, run_in_preview=false. In some cases, such as when a custom search command is used as part of the search, you might want to turn this on to ensure correct summary indexable previews are generated. Default: false spool Syntax: spool=<bool> Description: If set to true, the summary indexing file is written to the Splunk spool directory, where it is indexed automatically. If set to false, the file is written to the $SPLUNK_HOME/var/run/splunk/collect directory. The file remains in this directory unless some form of further automation or administration is done. If you have Splunk Enterprise, you can use this command to troubleshoot summary indexing by dumping the output file to a location on disk where it will not be ingested as data. Default: true source Syntax: source=<string> Description: The name of the source that you want to specify for the events. This option is not valid when output_format=hec. sourcetype Syntax: sourcetype=<string> Description: The name of the source type that you want to specify for the events. If you specify a source type other than stash, the ingested summary data will count against your license usage. This option is not valid when output_format=hec. Default: stash testmode Syntax: testmode=<bool> Description: Toggle between testing and real mode. In testing mode the results are not written into the new index but the search results are modified to appear as they would if sent to the index. Default: false timeformat Syntax: timeformat=<string> Description: Controls the format of the timestamp that is written to the stash file before it is indexed. The addtime argument must be set to true for the same invocation of the command in order to take advantage of this functionality. Use this argument only if you need precise control over the format of output files that the collect command generates. This option is not valid when output_format=hec. Default: %m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S %z uselb Syntax: uselb=<bool> Description: Controls how line breaks are used to split events. When set to true , the data that is ingested using the collect command is split into individual events. A string identical to the LINE_BREAKER setting defined for the stash_new source type in the props.conf file is used. When set to false , a simple line break is used to split events. Do not use this argument unless you are intentionally generating events with the collect command in a line-oriented format. This option is not valid when output_format=hec. NOTE: While the default behavior of the collect command is to use a LINE_BREAKER setting identical to that used in the props.conf file, the default LINE_BREAKER for the collect command is hardcoded. Changes to props.conf setting do NOT affect the behavior of the uselb option.

{"id": "5cc4908f720b1828", "content": "The events are written to a file whose name format is: random-num _events.stash , unless overwritten, in a directory that your Splunk deployment is monitoring. If the events contain a _raw field, then this field is saved. If the events do not have a _raw field, one is created by concatenating all the fields into a comma-separated list of key=value pairs. The collect command also works with real-time searches that have a time range of All time. Events without timestamps If you apply the collect command to events that do not have timestamps, the command designates a time for all of the events using the earliest (or minimum) time of the search range. For example, if you use the collect command over the past four hours (range: -4h to +0h), the command assigns a timestamp that is four hours prior to the time that the search was launched. The timestamp is applied to all of the events without a timestamp. If you use the collect command with a time range of All time and the events do not have timestamps, the current system time is used for the timestamps. For more information on summary indexing of data without timestamps, see Use summary indexing for increased reporting efficiency in the Knowledge Manager Manual. Copying events to a different index You can use the collect command to copy search results to another index. Construct a search that returns the data you want to copy, and pipe the results to the collect command. For example: This search writes the results into the bar index. The sourcetype is changed to stash. You can specify a sourcetype with the collect command. However, specifying a sourcetype counts against your license, as if you indexed the data again. Change how collect summarizes multivalue fields on Splunk Enterprise By default, the collect command summarizes multivalue fields as multivalue fields. For example, when collect summarizes the multivalue field alphabet = a, b, c , it adds the following field to the summary index: However, you might prefer the collect command to break multivalue fields into separate field-value pairs when it adds them to a _raw field in a summary index. For example, if given the multivalue field alphabet = a,b,c , you can have the collect command add the following fields to a _raw event in the summary index: alphabet = \"a\", alphabet = \"b\", alphabet = \"c\" If you are using Splunk Enterprise and you prefer to have collect follow this multivalue field summarization format, set the limits.conf setting format_multivalue_collect to true. To change the format_multivalue_collect setting in your local limits.conf file and enable collect to break multivalue fields into separate fields, follow these steps. Prerequisites Only users with file system access, such as system administrators, can edit configuration files. Review the steps in How to edit a configuration file in the Splunk Enterprise Admin Manual. CAUTION: Never change or copy the configuration files in the default directory. The files in the default directory must remain intact and in their original location. Make changes to the files in the local directory. Steps Open or create a local limits.conf file at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local. Under the [collect] stanza, set format_multivalue_collect to true. The collect and tstats commands The collect command does not segment data by major breakers and minor breakers , such as characters like spaces, square or curly brackets, parenthesis, semicolons, exclamation points, periods, and colons. As a result, if either major or minor breakers are found in value strings, Splunk software places quotation marks around field values when it adds events to the summary index. These extra quotation marks can cause problems for subsequent searches. In particular, field values that have quotation marks around them can't be used in tstats searches with the PREFIX() directive. This is because PREFIX() does not support major breakers like quotation marks. For example, in the following search with the collect command, the field values in quotes include periods as minor breakers. The search results look something like this. So far, that looks fine, right? Not exactly. Although there aren't any extra quotation marks around the field values buttercupgames.com and 2.0 that are displayed in the search results, you will see them if you look in summary index. To see what is in the summary index, run the following search: Now you can see version=\"2.0\" and application=\"buttercupgames.com\". The results look something like this: If you want to run a tstats search with the PREFIX() directive using those field values with quotation marks that are collected in a summary index like our previous example, you will need to edit your limits.conf file. You can do this by changing the collect_ignore_minor_breakers setting in the [collect] stanza from the default to true.

{"id": "7163cd590c396d3e", "content": "The loadjob command is an event-generating command. See Command types. Generating commands use a leading pipe character and should be the first command in a search. The loadjob command can be used for a variety of purposes, but one of the most useful is to run a fairly expensive search that calculates statistics. You can use loadjob searches to display those statistics for further aggregation, categorization, field selection and other manipulations for charting and display. After a search job has completed and the results are cached, you can use this command to access or load the results. Search head clusters A search head cluster can run the loadjob command only on scheduled saved searches. A search head cluster runs searches on results or artifacts that the search head cluster replicates. For more information on artifact replication, see Search head clustering architecture in the Distributed Search manual. Controlling truncation in search results To improve the speed of searches, Splunk software truncates the output of a search by default. For example, if the full output set is 10,000 events, the loadjob command might return only 1,000 events. Note: When a successful search is run, it returns either events or results. Events are returned if the commands in the search only filter the data. Results are returned if one of the commands in the search is a transforming command, such as the table command. If your search returns events and you don't want the output truncated, you can add the table command to the end of your search. The table command returns results instead of events. For example: Because the search returns results and not events, when you use the loadjob command all of the results are returned. Splunk Enterprise If search performance is not a concern, you can use the read_final_results_from_timeliner setting in the limits.conf file to control whether results are truncated when running the loadjob command. When read_final_results_from_timeliner is set to 'true', which is the default, the loadjob search returns the sample of the final results, not the full result set. For example, if the full result set is 10,000 results, the search might return only 1,000 results. When read_final_results_from_timeliner is set to 'false', the loadjob search returns the full set of search results. For example, if the full result set is 10,000 results, the search returns 10,000 results. To change the read_final_results_from_timeliner setting, follow these steps.

{"id": "c64ba663415d06ec", "content": "In Splunk deployments that have distributed search, a two-phase map-reduce process is typically used to determine the final result set for the search. Search results are mapped at the indexer layer and then reduced at the search head. The redistribute command inserts an intermediary reduce phase to the map-reduce process, making it a three-phase map-reduce-reduce process. This three-phase process is parallel reduce search processing. In the intermediary reduce phase, a subset of the indexers become intermediate reducers. The intermediate reducers perform reduce operations for the search commands and then pass the results on to the search head, where the final result reduction and aggregation operations are performed. This parallelization of reduction work that otherwise would be done entirely by the search head can result in faster completion times for high-cardinality searches that aggregate large numbers of search results. For information about managing parallel reduce processing at the indexer level, including configuring indexers to operate as intermediate reducers, see Overview of parallel reduce search processing , in the Distributed Search manual. Note: If you use Splunk Cloud Platform, use redistribute only when your indexers are operating with a low to medium average load. You do not need to perform any configuration tasks to use the redistribute command. Supported commands The redistribute command supports only streaming commands and the following nonstreaming commands: stats tstats streamstats eventstats sichart sitimechart The redistribute command also supports the transaction command, when the transaction command is operating on only one field. For example, the redistribute command cannot support the transaction command when the following conditions are true: The redistribute command has multiple fields in its <by-clause> argument. The transaction command has multiple fields in its <field-list> argument. You use the transaction command in a mode where no field is specified. For best performance, place redistribute immediately before the first supported nonstreaming command that has high-cardinality input. When search processing moves to the search head The redistribute command moves the processing of a search string from the intermediate reducers to the search head in the following circumstances: It encounters a nonstreaming command that it does not support. It encounters a command that it supports but that does not include a split-by field. It encounters a command that it supports and that includes split-by fields, but the split-by fields are not a superset of the fields that are specified in the by-clause argument of the redistribute command. It detects that a command modifies values of the fields specified in the by-clause of the redistribute command. Using the by-clause to determine how results are partitioned on the reducers At the start of the intermediate reduce phase, the redistribute command takes the mapped search results and redistributes them into partitions on the intermediate reducers according to the fields specified by the by-clause argument. If you do not specify any by-clause fields, the search processor uses the field or fields that work best with the commands that follow the redistribute command in the search string. Command type The redistribute command is an orchestrating command , which means that it controls how a search runs. It does not focus on the events processed by the search. The redistribute command instructs the distributed search query planner to convert centralized streaming data into distributed streaming data by distributing it across the intermediate reducers. For more information about command types, see Types of commands in the Search Manual. Setting the default number of intermediate reducers The default value for the num_of_reducers argument is controlled by three settings in the limits.conf file: maxReducersPerPhase , winningRate , and reducers. If you decide to add 7 of your indexers to the reducers list, the winningRate setting ceases to be applied, and the num_of_reducers argument defaults to 4 indexers. The Splunk platform randomly selects four indexers from the reducers list to act as intermediate reducers each time you run a valid redistribute search. Note: If you provide a value for the num_of_reducers argument that exceeds the limit set by the maxReducersPerPhase setting, the Splunk platform sets the number of reducers to the maxReducersPerPhase value. The redistribute command and search head data Searches that use the redistribute command ignore all data on the search head. If you plan to use the redistribute command, the best practice is to forward all search head data to the indexer layer. See Best Practice: Forward search head data to the indexer layer in the Distributed Search manual. Using the redistribute command in chart and timechart searches If you want to add the redistribute command to a search that uses the chart or timechart commands to produce statistical results that can be used for chart visualizations, include either the sichart command or the sitimechart command in the search as well. The redistribute command uses these si- commands to perform the statistical calculations for the reporting commands on the intermediate reducers. When the redistribute command moves the results to the search head, the chart or timechart command transforms the results into a format that can be used for chart visualizations. A best practice is to use the same syntax and values for both commands. For example, if you want to have | timechart count by referrer_domain in your redistribute search, insert | sitimechart count by referrer_domain into the search string: If an order-sensitive command is present in the search Certain commands that the redistribute command supports explicitly return results in a sorted order. As a result of the partitioning that takes place when the redistribute command is run, the Splunk platform loses the sorting order. If the Splunk platform detects that an order-sensitive command, such as streamstats , is used in a redistribute search, it automatically inserts sort into the search as it processes it. For example, the following search includes the streamstats command, which is order-sensitive: The Splunk platform adds a sort segment before the streamstats segment when it processes the search. You can see the sort segment in the search string if you inspect the search job after you run it. The stats and streamstats segments are processed on the intermediate reducers because they both split by the host field, the same field that the redistribute command is distributing on. The work of the sort segment is split between the indexers during the map phase of the search and the search head during the final reduce phase of the search. If you require sorted results from a redistribute search If you require the results of a redistribute search to be sorted in that exact order, use sort to perform the sorting at the search head. There is an additional performance cost to event sorting after the redistribute command partitions events on the intermediate reducers. The following search provides ordered results: If you want to get that same event ordering while also adding redistribute to the search to speed it up, add sort to the search: The stats segment of this search is processed on the intermediate reducers. The work of the sort segment is split between the indexers during the map phase of the search and the search head during the final reduce phase of the search.

{"id": "449214e48ab78862", "content": "1. Speed up a search on a large high-cardinality dataset In this example, the redistribute command is applied to a stats search that is running over an extremely large high-cardinality dataset. The redistribute command reduces the completion time for the search. The intermediate reducers process the | stats count by ip portion of the search in parallel, lowering the completion time for the search. The search head aggregates the results. 2. Speed up a timechart search without declaring a by-clause field to redistribute on This example uses a search over an extremely large high-cardinality dataset. The search string includes the eventstats command, and it uses the sitimechart command to perform the statistical calculations for a timechart operation. The search uses the redistribute command to reduce the completion time for the search. A by-clause field is not specified, so the search processor selects one. When this search runs, the intermediate reducers process the eventstats and sitimechart segments of the search in parallel, reducing the overall completion time of the search. On the search head, the timechart command takes the reduced sitimechart calculations and transforms them into a format that can be used for for charts and visualizations. Because a by-clause field is not identified in the search string, the intermediate reducers redistribute and partition events on the source field. 3. Speed up a search that uses tstats to generate events This example uses a search over an extremely large high-cardinality dataset. This search uses the tstats command in conjunction with the sitimechart and timechart commands. The redistribute command reduces the completion time for the search. You have to place the tstats command at the start of the search string with a leading pipe character. When you use the redistribute command in conjunction with tstats , you must place the redistribute command after the tstats segment of the search. In this example, the tstats command uses the prestats=t argument to work with the sitimechart and timechart commands. The redistribute command causes the intermediate reducers to process the sitimechart segment of the search in parallel, reducing the overall completion time for the search. The reducers then push the results to the search head, where the timechart command processes them into a format that you can use for charts and visualizations. 4. Speed up a search that includes a mix of supported and unsupported commands This example uses a search over an extremely large high-cardinality dataset. The search uses the redistribute command to reduce the search completion time. The search includes commands that are both supported and unsupported by the redistribute command. It uses the sort command to sort of the results after the rest of the search has been processed. You need the sort command for event sorting because the redistribute process undoes the sorting naturally provided by commands in the stats command family. In this example, the intermediate reducers process the eventstats and where segments in parallel. Those portions of the search complete faster than they would when the redistribute command is not used. The Splunk platform divides the work of processing the sort portion of the search between the indexer and the search head. 5. Speed up a search where a supported command splits by fields that are not in the redistribute command by-clause argument In this example, the redistribute command redistributes events across the intermediate reducers by the source field. The search includes two commands that are supported by the redistribute command but only one of them is processed on the intermediate reducers. In this case, the eventstats segment of the search is processed in parallel by the intermediate reducers because it includes source as a split-by field. The where segment is also processed on the intermediate reducers. The stats portion of the search, however, is processed on the search head because its split-by fields are not a superset of the set of fields that the events have been redistributed by.

{"id": "2fdc6542dc5af517", "content": "You use the meventcollect command to convert streaming events into metric data to be stored in a metric index on the indexers. The metrics data uses a specific format for the metrics fields. See Metrics data format in Metrics. Only streaming commands can precede the meventcollect command so that results can be ingested on the indexers. If you would like to run a search that uses transforming commands to generate metric data points, use mcollect instead of meventcollect. CAUTION: The meventcollect command causes new data to be written to a metric index for every run of the search. In addition, if you run an meventcollect search over large amounts of data, it potentially can overwhelm indexers and indexer clusters that do not have a significant amount of capacity. Note: All metrics search commands are case sensitive. This means, for example, that meventcollect treats as the following as three distinct values of metric_name : cap.gear , CAP.GEAR , and Cap.Gear. The Splunk platform cannot index metric data points that contain metric_name fields which are empty or composed entirely of white spaces. How to use the split argument The split argument determines how meventcollect identifies the measurement fields in your search. It defaults to false. When split=false , your search needs to explicitly identify its measurement fields. If necessary it can use rename or eval conversions to do this. If you have single-metric events, your meventcollect search must produce results with a metric_name field that provides the name of the measure, and a _value field that provides the measure's numeric value. If you have multiple-metric events, your meventcollect search must produce results that follow this syntax: metric_name:<metric_name>=<numeric_value>. Each of these fields will be treated as a measurement. meventcollect treats the remaining fields as dimensions. When you set split=true , you use field-list to identify the dimensions in your search. meventcollect converts any field that is not in the field-list into a measurement. The only exceptions are internal fields beginning with an underscore and the prefix_field , if you have set one. When you set split=allnums , meventcollect treats all numeric fields as metric measures and all non-numeric fields as dimensions. You can optionally use field-list to declare that meventcollect should treat certain numeric fields in the events as dimensions. Set a prefix field Use the prefix_field argument to apply a prefix to the metric fields in your event data. For example, if you have the following data: type=cpu usage=0.78 idle=0.22 You have two metric fields, usage and idle. Say you include the following in an mcatalog search of that data: Because you have set split = true the Splunk software automatically converts those fields into measures, because they are not otherwise identified in a <field-list>. Then it applies the value of the specified prefix_field as a prefix to the metric field names. In this case, because you have specified the type field as the prefix field, its value, cpu , becomes the metric name prefix. The results look like this:", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "...split=trueprefix_field=type..."}], "tables": [{"headers": ["metric_name:cpu.usage", "metric_name:cpu.idle"], "rows": [["0.78", "0.22"]]}], "chunk_index": 2, "total_chunks": 5, "metadata": {"title": "meventcollect", "section_heading": "Usage", "section_id": "e3a578e3_8253_4430_a5d5_86705f566820--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/search-commands/meventcollect", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise (10.2) > Search > SPL Search Reference > Search Commands", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T13:55:44.939467+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

By default, the return command uses only the first row of results. You can specify multiple rows, for example ' return 2 ip '. Each row is viewed as an OR clause, that is, output might be ' (ip=10.1.11.2) OR (ip=10.2.12.3) '. Multiple values can be specified and are placed within OR clauses. So, ' return 2 user ip ' might output ' (user=bob ip=10.1.11.2) OR (user=fred ip=10.2.12.3) '. In most cases, using the return command at the end of a subsearch removes the need for head , fields , rename , format , and dedup. Duplicate values Suppose you have the following search: You might logically expect the command to return the first two distinct users. Instead the command looks at the first two events, based on the ordering from the implied head command. The return command returns the users within those two events. The command does not determine if the user value is unique. If the same user is listed in these events, the command returns only the one user. To return unique values, you need to include the dedup command in your search. For example: When the input for 'return' is 0 events When the input to the return command is 0 events, the results of the search can be misleading. To avoid this, test your subsearches outside of the main search to verify that they return events. For example, say you have the following search: If index=A test_errror returns 0 events, the subsearch returns an empty string. The final result of the full search is all events from index=B. If you are unaware of the result of the subsearch, this could lead you to believe that all events from index=B satisfied the condition of having test_error for their clientip , when in fact none did. Quotations in returned fields The return command does not escape quotation marks that are in the fields that are returned. You must use an eval command to escape the quotation marks before you use the return command. For example: If you encounter problems with the return command If you encounter difficulties when running the return command, consider running the oldreturn command instead. oldreturn is a deprecated version of return that does not require spaces around the = symbol for the alias argument.

Analyze the relationship between fields in web access log files This example demonstrates one way to analyze the relationship of fields in your web access logs. The first part of this search retrieves web access events that returned a status that is not 200. Web access data contains many fields. You can use the associate command to see a relationship between all pairs of fields and values in your data. To simplify this example, restrict the search to two fields: method and status. Because the associate command adds many columns to the output, this search uses the table command to display only select columns. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: In the results you can see that there is one method and five status values in the results. From the first row of results, you can see that when method=POST , the status field is 503 for those events. The associate command concludes that, if method=POST , the Top_Conditional_Value is likely to be 503 as much as 33% of the time. The Reference_Key and Reference_Value are being correlated to the Target_Key. The Top_Conditional_Value field states three things: The most common value for the given Reference_Value. The frequency of the Reference_Value for that field in the dataset, sometimes referred to as FRV. The frequency of the most common associated value in the Target_Key for the events that have the specific Reference_Value in that Reference Key. Sometimes referred to as the FCV.

This results in the following output: 4. Use emptystr to indicate empty results When a search generates empty results, the format command returns internal fields and the contents of emptystr. You can change the value of emptystr from the default to a custom string. For example, the results in the following search are empty, so format returns a customized string \"Error Found\" in a new field called search. The results look something like this. If your search doesn't include emptystr like the following example, the format command displays the default empty string to indicate that the results are empty. The results look like this. 5. Use emptystr in a subsearch as a failsafe Customizing your empty string as shown in the last example is one way to use emptystr. However, it is more typical to use the format command as a subsearch that is operating as a search filter, and then use emptystr as a failsafe in case your search returns empty results. For example, perhaps your index isn't generating results because one of the fields you're specifying in the subsearch doesn't exist or there's a typo or some other error in your search. You can include the emptystr argument and set it to a default source type that you know is always present, such as splunkd. Then, instead of returning nothing, your search will return some results that you can use for further filtering. You can use the following sample search to make sure you get results even if your search contains errors.

The values in the _time field change each time you rerun the search. However, in this example the values in the results table are not changed so that we can focus on how the changes to the search impact the results. 1. Start by creating a simple set of 5 results by using the makeresults command. There are 5 results created, each with the same timestamp. 2. To keep better track of each result use the streamstats command to add a field that numbers each result. The a field is added to the results. 3. Additionally, use the eval command to change the timestamps to be 60 seconds apart. Different timestamps make this example more realistic. The minute portion of the timestamp is updated. 4. Next use the eval command to create a field to use as the field to join the results on. The new field is added. 5. Use the eval command to create some fields with data. An if function is used with a modulo (modulus) operation to add different data to each of the new fields. A modulo operation finds the remainder after the division of one number by another number: The eval b command processes each result and performs a modulo operation. If the remainder of a/2 is 0, put \"something\" into the field \"b\", otherwise put \"nada\" into field \"b\". The eval c command processes each result and performs a modulo operation. If the remainder a/2 is 1, put \"something else\" into the field \"c\", otherwise put nothing (NULL) into field \"c\". The new fields are added and the fields are arranged in alphabetical order by field name, except for the _time field. 6. Use the selfjoin command to join the results on the joiner field. The results are joined. 7. To understand how the selfjoin command joins the results together, remove the | selfjoin joiner portion of the search. Then modify the search to append the values from the a field to the values in the b and c fields. The results now have the row number appended to the values in the b and c fields. 8. Now add the selfjoin command back into the search. The results of the self join. If there are values for a field in both rows, the last result row, based on the _time value, takes precedence. The joins performed are shown in the following table.

{"id": "9b345580feb83b98", "content": "1. Use the append command to add column totals. Count the number of earthquakes that occurred in and around California yesterday and then calculate the total number of earthquakes. This example uses a subsearch to count all the earthquakes in the California regions ( place=\"*California\" ), then uses the main search to count the number of earthquakes based on the magnitude type of the search. You cannot use the stats command to simultaneously count the total number of events and the number of events for a specified field. The subsearch is used to count the total number of earthquakes that occurred. This count is added to the results of the previous search with the append command. Because both searches share the count field, the results of the subsearch are listed as the last row in the count column. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: This search demonstrates how to use the append command in a way that is similar to using the addcoltotals command to add the column totals. 2. Count the number of different customers who purchased items. Append the top purchaser for each type of product. Count the number of different customers who purchased something from the Buttercup Games online store yesterday, and break this count down by the type of product (accessories, t-shirts, and type of games) they purchased. Also, list the top purchaser for each type of product and how much that person bought of that product. This example first searches for purchase events ( action=purchase ). These results are piped into the stats command and the dc() , or distinct_count() function is used to count the number of different users who make purchases. The BY clause is used to break up this number based on the different category of products ( categoryId ). This example contains a subsearch as an argument for the append command. The subsearch is used to search for purchase events and count the top purchaser (based on clientip ) for each category of products. These results are added to the results of the previous search using the append command. Here, the table command is used to display only the category of products ( categoryId ), the distinct count of users who bought each type of product ( dc(clientip) ), the actual user who bought the most of a product type ( clientip ), and the number of each product that user bought ( count ). You can see that the append command just tacks on the results of the subsearch to the end of the previous search, even though the results share the same field values. It does not let you manipulate or reformat the output. 3. Use the append command to determine the number of unique IP addresses that accessed the Web server. Use the append command, along with the stats , count , and top commands to determine the number of unique IP addresses that accessed the Web server. Find the user who accessed the Web server the most for each type of page request. Count the number of different IP addresses that accessed the Web server and also find the user who accessed the Web server the most for each type of page request ( method ). The Web access events are piped into the stats command and the dc() or distinct_count() function is used to count the number of different users who accessed the site. The count() function is used to count the total number of times the site was accessed. These numbers are separated by the page request ( method ). The subsearch is used to find the top user for each type of page request ( method ). The append command is used to add the result of the subsearch to the bottom of the table. The results appear on the Statistics tab and look something like this: The first two rows are the results of the first search. The last two rows are the results of the subsearch. Both result sets share the method and count fields. 4. Specify the maximum time for the subsearch to run and the maximum number of result rows from the subsearch Use the append command, to determine the number of unique IP addresses that accessed the Web server. Find the user who accessed the Web server the most for each type of page request. Count the number of different IP addresses that accessed the Web server and also find the user who accessed the Web server the most for each type of page request ( method ).

Use the rex command to either extract fields using regular expression named groups, or replace or substitute characters in a field using sed expressions. Use the regex command to remove results that do not match the specified regular expression. Regular expressions Splunk SPL supports perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE). When you use regular expressions in searches, you need to be aware of how characters such as pipe ( | ) and backslash ( \\ ) are handled. See SPL and regular expressions in the Search Manual. For general information about regular expressions, see About Splunk regular expressions in the Knowledge Manager Manual. Sed expressions When using the rex command in sed mode, you have two options: replace (s) or character substitution (y). The syntax for using sed to replace (s) text in your data is: \"s/<regex>/<replacement>/<flags>\" <regex> is a PCRE regular expression, which can include capturing groups. <replacement> is a string to replace the regex match. Use \\n for back references, where \"n\" is a single digit. <flags> can be either g to replace all matches, or a number to replace a specified match. The syntax for using sed to substitute characters is: \"y/<string1>/<string2>/\" This substitutes the characters that match <string1> with the characters in <string2>. When using the rex command in sed mode, the rex command supports the same sed expressions as the SEDCMD setting in the props.conf.in file. Anonymize multiline text using sed expressions The Splunk platform doesn't support applying sed expressions in multiline mode. To use a sed expression to anonymize multiline events, use 2 sed expressions in succession by first removing the newlines and then performing additional replacements.

For example, you have events such as: When the events were indexed, the From and To values were not identified as fields. You can use the rex command to extract the field values and create from and to fields in your search results. The from and to lines in the _raw events follow an identical pattern. Each from line is From: and each to line is To:. The email addresses are enclosed in angle brackets. You can use this pattern to create a regular expression to extract the values and create the fields. You can remove duplicate values and return only the list of address by adding the dedup and table commands to the search. The results look something like this: 2. Extract from multi-valued fields using max_match You can use the max_match argument to specify that the regular expression runs multiple times to extract multiple values from a field. For example, use the makeresults command to create a field with multiple values: The results look something like this: To extract each of the values in the test field separately, you use the max_match argument with the rex command. For example: The results look something like this: 3. Extract values from a field in scheduler.log events Extract \"user\", \"app\" and \"SavedSearchName\" from a field called \"savedsearch_id\" in scheduler.log events. If savedsearch_id=bob;search;my_saved_search then user=bob , app=search and SavedSearchName=my_saved_search 4. Use a sed expression Use sed syntax to match the regex to a series of numbers and replace them with an anonymized string. 5. Use a sed expression with capture replace for strings This example shows how to use the rex command sed expression with capture replace using \\1, \\2 to reuse captured pieces of a string. This search creates an event with three fields, _time , search , and orig_search. The regular expression removes the quotation marks and any leading or trailing spaces around the quotation marks. The results look like this: 6. Use an offset_field To identify the position of certain values in a field, use the rex command with the offset_field argument and a regular expression. The following example starts with the makeresults command to create a field with a value: The results look something like this: Add the rex command with the offset_field argument to the search to create a field called off. You can identify the position of the first five values in the field list using the regular expression \"(?<firstfive>abcde)\". For example: The results look something like this: You can identify the position of several of the middle values in the field list using the regular expression \"(?<middle>fgh)\". For example: The results look something like this: 7. Display IP address and ports of potential attackers Display IP address and ports of potential attackers.

Description: The names of the fields for the variable that you want to predict. You can specify one or more fields. Optional arguments <newfield> Syntax: <string> Description: Renames the fields that are specified in the <field-list>. You do not need to rename every field that you specify in the <field-list>. However, for each field that you want to rename, you must specify a separate AS <newfield> clause. <predict_options> Syntax: algorithm=<algorithm_name> | correlate_field=<field> | future_timespan=<number> | holdback=<number> | period=<number> | suppress=<bool> | lowerXX=<field> | upperYY=<field> Description: Options you can specify to control the predictions. You can specify one or more options, in any order. Each of these options is described in the Predict options section. Predict options algorithm Syntax: algorithm= LL | LLT | LLP | LLP5 | LLB | BiLL Description: Specify the name of the forecasting algorithm to apply. LL, LLT, LLP, and LLP5 are univariate algorithms. LLB and BiLL are bivariate algorithms. All the algorithms are variations based on the Kalman filter. Each algorithm expects a minimum number of data points. If not enough effective data points are supplied, an error message is displayed. For instance, the field itself might have more than enough data points, but the number of effective data points might be small if the holdback value that you specify is large. Default: LLP5 correlate Syntax: correlate=<field> Description: Specifies the time series that the LLB algorithm uses to predict the other time series. Required when you specify the LLB algorithm. Not used for any other algorithm. Default: None future_timespan Syntax: future_timespan=<num> Description: Specifies how many future predictions the predict command will compute. This number must be a non-negative number. You would not use the future_timespan option if algorithm=LLB. Default: 5 holdback Syntax: holdback=<num> Description: Specifies the number of data points from the end that are not to be used by the predict command. Use in conjunction with the future_timespan argument. For example, 'holdback=10 future_timespan=10' computes the predicted values for the last 10 values in the data set. You can then judge how accurate the predictions are by checking whether the actual data point values fall into the predicted confidence intervals. Default: 0 lowerXX Syntax: lower<int>=<field> Description: Specifies a percentage for the confidence interval and a field name to use for the lower confidence interval curve. The <int> value is a percentage that specifies the confidence level. The integer must be a number between 0 and 100. The <field> value is the field name. Default: The default confidence interval is 95%. The default field name is 'lower95(prediction(X))' where X is the name of the field to be predicted. period Syntax: period=<num> Description: Specifies the length of the time period, or recurring cycle, in the time series data. The number must be at least 2. The LLP and LLP5 algorithms attempt to compute the length of time period if no value is specified. If you specify the span argument with the timechart command, the unit that you specify for span is the unit used for period. For example, if your search is ...|timechart span=1d foo2| predict foo2 period=3. The spans are 1 day and the period for the predict is 3 days. Otherwise, the unit for the time period is a data point. For example, if there are a thousand events, then each event is a unit. If you specify period=7 , that means the data recycles after every 7 data points, or events. Default: None suppress Syntax: suppress=<field> Description: Used with the multivariate algorithms. Specifies one of the predicted fields to hide from the output. Use suppress when it is difficult to see all of the predicted visualizations at the same time.

The <int> value is a percentage that specifies the confidence level. This must be a number between 0 and 100. The <field> value is the field name. Default: The default confidence interval is 95%. The default field name is 'upper95(prediction(X))' where X is the name of the field to be predicted. Confidence intervals The lower and upper confidence interval parameters default to lower95 and upper95. These values specify a confidence interval where 95% of the predictions are expected fall.

See the Examples section for more details. How it works The predict command models the data by stipulating that there is an unobserved entity which progresses through time in different states. To predict a value, the command calculates the best estimate of the state by considering all of the data in the past. To compute estimates of the states, the command hypothesizes that the states follow specific linear equations with Gaussian noise components. Under this hypothesis, the least-squares estimate of the states are calculated efficiently. This calculation is called the Kalman filter, or Kalman-Bucy filter. For each state estimate, a confidence interval is obtained. The estimate is not a point estimate. The estimate is a range of values that contain the observed, or predicted, values. The measurements might capture only some aspect of the state, but not necessarily the whole state. Missing values The predict command can work with data that has missing values. The command calculates the best estimates of the missing values. Do not remove events with missing values, Removing the events might distort the periodicity of the data. Do not specify cont=false with the timechart command. Specifying cont=false removes events with missing values.

Determine which heartbeats are later than expected You can use this example to track heartbeats from hosts, forwarders, tcpin_connections on indexers, or any number of system components. This example uses hosts. You have a list of host names in a lookup file called expected_hosts. You want to search for heartbeats from your hosts that are after an expected time range. You use the addinfo command to add information to each event that will help you evaluate the time range. Use the stats command to calculate the latest heartbeat by host. The addinfo command adds information to each result. This search uses info_max_time , which is the latest time boundary for the search. The eval command is used to create a field called latest_age and calculate the age of the heartbeats relative to end of the time range. This allows for a time range of -11m@m to -m@m. This is the previous 11 minutes, starting at the beginning of the minute, to the previous 1 minute, starting at the beginning of the minute. The search does not work if you specify latest=null / all time because info_max_time would be set to +infinity. Using the lookup file, expected_hosts , append the list of hosts to the results. Using this list you can determine which hosts are not sending a heartbeat in the expected time range. For any hosts that have a null value in the latest_age field, fill the field with the value 9999. Remove any duplicated host events with the dedup command. Use the where command to filter the results and return any heartbeats older than 42 seconds.

{"id": "55da8f0ec4e2cb7b", "content": "The metadata command is a report-generating command. See Command types. Generating commands use a leading pipe character and should be the first command in a search. Although the metadata command fetches data from all peers, any command run after it runs only on the search head. The command shows the first, last, and most recent events that were seen for each value of the specified metadata type. For example, if you search for: Your results should look something like this: The firstTime field is the timestamp for the first time that the indexer saw an event from this host. The lastTime field is the timestamp for the last time that the indexer saw an event from this host. The recentTime field is the indextime for the most recent time that the index saw an event from this host. In other words, this is the time of the last update. The totalcount field is the total number of events seen from this host. The type field is the specified type of metadata to display. Because this search specifies type=hosts , there is also a host column. In most cases, when the data is streaming live, the lastTime and recentTime field values are equal. If the data is historical, however, the values might be different. In small testing environments, the data is complete. However, in environments with large numbers of values for each category, the data might not be complete. This is intentional and allows the metadata command to operate within reasonable time and memory usage. Real-time searches Running the metadata command in a real-time search that returns a large number of results will very quickly consume all the available memory on the Splunk server. Use caution when you use the metadata command in real-time searches. Time ranges Set the time range using the Time Range Picker. You cannot use the earliest or latest time range modifiers in the search string. Time range modifiers must be set before the first piped command and generating commands in general do not allow anything to be specified before the first pipe. If you specify a time range other than All Time for your search, the search results might not be precise. The metadata is stored as aggregate numbers for each bucket on the index. A bucket is either included or not included based on the time range you specify. For example, you run the following search specifying a time range of Last 7 days. The time range corresponds to January 1st to January 7th. There is a bucket on the index that contains events from both December 31st and January 1st. The metadata from that bucket is included in the information returned from search. Maximum results By default, a maximum of 10,000 results are returned.

Sort the event list in descending order, with highest value in the unexpectedness field listed first. 2. Find anomalies in transactions This example uses transactions to find regions of time that look unusual. 3. Identify anomalies by source Look for anomalies in each source separately. A pattern in one source does not affect that it is anomalous in another source. 4. Specify a threshold when identifying anomalies This example shows how to tune a search for anomalies using the threshold value. Start with a search that uses the default threshold value. This search looks at events in the _internal index and calculates an unexpectedness score for sets of events that have the same group value. The sliding set of events that are used to calculate the unexpectedness score for each unique group value includes only the events that have the same group value. The search command is used to show events that only include the group field. The unexpectedness and group fields appear in the list of Interesting fields. Click on the field name and then click Yes to move the field to the Selected fields list. The fields are moved and also appear in the search results. Your results should look something like the following image. The key-value pairs in the first event include group=pipeline , name=indexerpipe , processor=indexer , cpu_seconds=0.022 , and so forth. With the default threshold , which is 0.01, you can see that some of these events might be very similar. The next search increases the threshold a little: With the higher threshold value, the timestamps and key-value pairs show more distinction between each of the events. Also, you might not want to hide the events that are not anomalous. Instead, you can add another field to your events that tells you whether or not the event is interesting to you. One way to do this is with the eval command: This search uses labelonly=true so that the boring events are still retained in the results list. The eval command is used to define a field named threshold and set it to the threshold value. This has to be done explicitly because the threshold attribute of the anomalies command is not a field. The second eval command is used to define another new field, score , that is either \"anomalous\" or \"boring\" based on how the unexpectedness compares to the threshold value.

The dataset must be a dataset that you created or are authorized to use. You can specify datamodel , savedsearch , or inputlookup. The dataset type must precede the dataset name. For example, savedsearch:<dataset-name>. You can use either <dataset-type>:<dataset-name> or <subsearch> with the join command, but not both. dataset-name Syntax: <dataset-name> Description: The name of the dataset that you want to use to join with the source data. The dataset must be a dataset that you created or are authorized to use. The dataset name must follow the dataset type. For example, if the dataset name is january and the dataset type is datamodel, you specify datamodel:january. You can use either <dataset-type>:<dataset-name> or <subsearch> with the join command, but not both. subsearch Syntax: [<subsearch>] Description: A secondary search or dataset that specifies the source of the events that you want to join to. The subsearch must be enclosed in square brackets. The results of the subsearch should not exceed available memory. You can use either <dataset-type>:<dataset-name> or <subsearch> in a search, but not both. When [<subsearch>] is used in a search by itself with no join keys, the Splunk software autodetects common fields and combines the search results before the join command with the results of the subsearch. Optional arguments join-options Syntax: type=(inner | outer | left) | usetime=<bool> | earlier=<bool> | overwrite=<bool> | max=<int> Description: Arguments to the join command. Use either outer or left to specify a left outer join. See Descriptions for the join-options argument in this topic. field-list Syntax: <field> <field> ... Description: Specify the list of fields to use for the join. For example, to join fields ProductA , ProductB , and ProductC , you would specify | join ProductA ProductB ProductC... If <field-list> is specified, one or more of the fields must be common to each dataset. If no fields are specified, all of the fields that are common to both datasets are used. The values of the fields used in <field-list> are case sensitive. For example, a value that is all uppercase in the main search will not match the same value that is all lowercase in the subsearch. See the example later in this topic about performing a case-insensitive join. left alias Syntax: left=<left-alias> Description: The alias to use with the left-side dataset, the source data, to avoid naming collisions. Must be combined with the right alias and where clause, or the alias is ignored. The left alias must be used together with the right alias. right alias Syntax: right=<right-alias> Description: The alias to use with the right-side dataset to avoid naming collisions. Must be combined with the left alias and the where clause, or the alias is ignored. The right alias must be used together with the left alias. where clause Syntax: where <left-alias>.<field>=<right-alias>.<field>... Description: Identifies the names of the fields in the left-side dataset and the right-side dataset that you want to join on. You must specify the left and right aliases and the field name. Fields that are joined from the left and right datasets do not have to have the same names. For example: where L.host=R.user matches events in the host field from the left dataset with events in the user field from the right dataset. The where clause must be used with the right and left aliases and field name. You can specify the aliases and fields in a where clause on either side of the equal sign. For example: where <left-alias>.<left-field>=<right-alias>.<right-field> or where <right-alias>.<right-field>=<left-alias>.<left-field> Descriptions for the join-options argument type Syntax: type=inner | outer | left Description: Indicates the type of join to perform. The difference between an inner and a left (or outer ) join is how the events are treated in the main search that do not match any of the events in the subsearch. In both inner and left joins, events that match are joined. The results of an inner join do not include events from the main search that have no matches in the subsearch. The results of a left (or outer ) join includes all of the events in the main search and only those values in the subsearch have matching field values. Default: inner usetime Syntax: usetime=<bool> Description: A Boolean value that Indicates whether to use time to limit the matches in the subsearch results. Used with the earlier option to limit the subsearch results to matches that are earlier or later than the main search results. If you use the join command with usetime=true and type=left , the search results are similar to those of an inner join. This is because there might be non-matching results when using the left join that are the same as those produced by an inner join. Default: false earlier Syntax: earlier=<bool> Description: If usetime=true and earlier=true , the main search results are matched only against earlier results from the subsearch. If earlier=false , the main search results are matched only against later results from the subsearch. Results that occur at the same time (second) are not eliminated by either value. Default: true overwrite Syntax: overwrite=<bool> Description: If fields in the main search results and subsearch results have the same name, indicates whether fields from the subsearch results overwrite the fields from the main search results. Default: true max Syntax: max=<int> Description: Specifies the maximum number of subsearch results that each main search result can join with. If set to max=0 , there is no limit.

See Command types. A subsearch can be initiated through a search command such as the join command. See Initiating subsearches with search commands in the Splunk Cloud Platform Search Manual. Limitations on subsearches in joins Use the join command when the results of the subsearch are relatively small, for example 50,000 rows or less. To minimize the impact of this command on performance and resource consumption, Splunk software imposes some default limitations on the subsearch. Limitations on the subsearch for the join command are specified in the limits.conf file. The default limitations include a maximum of 50,000 rows in the subsearch to join against, and a maximum search time of 60 seconds for the subsearch. See Subsearches in the Search Manual. Splunk Cloud Platform To change the limits.conf settings subsearch_maxout or subsearch_maxtime , use one of the following methods: The Configure limits page in Splunk Web. For more information, see Configure limits using Splunk Web in the Splunk Cloud Platform Admin Manual. The Admin Config Service (ACS) API. For more information, see Manage limits.conf configurations in Splunk Cloud Platform in the Splunk Cloud Platform Admin Config Service Manual.

Prerequisites Only users with file system access, such as system administrators, can edit configuration files. Review the steps in How to edit a configuration file in the Splunk Enterprise Admin Manual. CAUTION: Never change or copy the configuration files in the default directory. The files in the default directory must remain intact and in their original location. Make changes to the files in the local directory. Steps Open or create a local limits.conf file at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local on the search head. Under the [join] stanza, add the line subsearch_maxout = <value> or subsearch_maxtime = <value>.

The advantage of using the gauge command is that you can specify a set of range values instead of using the default range values of 0 to 100. Specifying ranges If you specify range values, you must specify at least two values. The gauge begins at the first value and ends at the last value that you specify. If you specify more than two range_val arguments, the intermediate range values are used to split the total range into subranges. Each subrange displays in different color, which creates a visual distinction. The range values are returned as a series of fields called y1 , y2 , and so on. If you do not specify range values, the range defaults to a low value of 0 and a high value of 100. If a single range value is specified, it is ignored. Gauge colors With a gauge chart, a single numerical value is mapped against a set of colors. These colors can have particular business meaning or business logic. As the value changes over time, the gauge marker changes position within this range. The color ranges in the gauge chart are based on the range values that you specify with the gauge command. When you specify range values, you define the overall numerical range represented by the gauge. You can define the size of the colored bands within that range.

{"id": "c5217321102bc5f6", "content": "The sort command is a dataset processing command. See Command types. By default, sort tries to automatically determine what it is sorting. If the field contains numeric values, the collating sequence is numeric. If the field contains on IP address values, the collating sequence is for IP addresses. Otherwise, the collating sequence is in lexicographical order. Some specific examples are: Alphabetic strings are sorted lexicographically. Punctuation strings are sorted lexicographically. Numeric data is sorted as you would expect for numbers and the sort order is specified as ascending or descending. Alphanumeric strings are sorted based on the data type of the first character. If the string starts with a number, the string is sorted numerically based on that number alone. Otherwise, strings are sorted lexicographically. Strings that are a combination of alphanumeric and punctuation characters are sorted the same way as alphanumeric strings. The sort order is determined between each pair of values that are compared at any one time. This means that for some pairs of values, the order might be lexicographical, while for other pairs the order might be numerical. Lexicographical order Lexicographical order sorts items based on the values used to encode the items in computer memory. In Splunk software, this is almost always UTF-8 encoding, which is a superset of ASCII. Numbers are sorted before letters. Numbers are sorted based on the first digit. For example, the numbers 10, 9, 70, 100 are sorted lexicographically as 10, 100, 70, 9. Uppercase letters are sorted before lowercase letters. Symbols are not standard. Some symbols are sorted before numeric values. Other symbols are sorted before or after letters. Custom sort order You can specify a custom sort order that overrides the lexicographical order.

Calculate the difference in the number of purchases between the top 10 buyers Find the top ten people who bought something yesterday, count how many purchases they made and the difference in the number of purchases between each buyer. The purchase events, action=purchase , are piped into the top command to find the top ten users, based on clientip , who bought something. These results, which include a count for each clientip are then piped into the delta command to calculate the difference between the count value of one event and the count value of the event preceding it, using the p=1 argument.

Calculate the difference in time between recent events Calculate the difference in time between each of the recent earthquakes in Alaska. Run the search using the time range All time. This example searches for earthquakes in Alaska. The delta command is used to calculate the difference in the timestamps, _time , between each earthquake and the one immediately before it. By default the difference is placed in a new field called delta(_time). The time is in seconds. The rename command is used to change the default field name to timeDeltaS. An eval command is used with the abs function to convert the time into the absolute value of the time. This conversion is necessary because the differences between one earthquake and the earthquake immediately before it result in negative values. Another eval command is used with the tostring function to convert the time, in seconds, into a string value.

You might also notice other values for the action field, such as addtocart and remove. The transactions are then piped into the delta command, which uses the _time field to calculate the time between one transaction and the transaction immediately preceding it. Specifically the difference between the timestamp for the last event in the transaction and the timestamp in the last event in the previous transaction. The search renames the time change as timeDelta. An eval command is used with the abs function to convert the time into the absolute value of the time.

The search results created by the makeresults command are created in temporary memory and are not saved to disk or indexed.

Note: Order-sensitive processors might fail if the internal _time field is absent. Specifying server and server groups If you use Splunk Cloud Platform, omit any server or server group argument. If you are using Splunk Enterprise, by default results are generated only on the originating search head, which is equivalent to specifying splunk_server=local. If you provide a specific splunk_server or splunk_server_group , then the number of results you specify with the count argument are generated on the all servers or server groups that you specify. If you specify a server, the results are generated for that server, regardless of the server group that the server is associated with. If you specify a count of 5 and you target 3 servers, then you will generate 15 total results. If annotate=true , the names for each server appear in the splunk_server column. This column will show that each server produced 5 results. Specifying servers for transparent mode federated searches If you run Federated Search for Splunk in transparent mode, to run a makeresults search, you must use either the splunk_server or the splunk_server_group argument to identify the local or remote search head, search head cluster, indexer, or indexer cluster over which you want to run your makeresults search. Note: If you do not identify the transparent mode server or servers that you want to run the search over, Splunk software blocks the makeresults search. For example, if you want to run your search over a search head on your transparent mode federated provider, and that search head is named sh1.kualalumpur.blue, you must add splunk_server=sh1.kualalumpur.blue to your makeresults search. For more information, see Run federated searches over remote Splunk platform deployments in Federated Search. Generating results from inline CSV- or JSON-formatted data Use the format and data arguments in conjunction to generate events from CSV- or JSON-formatted data. Inline JSON data must be provided as a series of JSON objects, all within a single JSON array. The makeresults command generates a separate event for each JSON object. The keys of that object become fields, and the object values become field values. Each key must be bracketed in escape quotes. The entire JSON array must be placed within double quotation marks ( \" ). Here is an example of JSON formatted data: Inline data in CSV format consists of a set of lines. The first line contains the schema, or headers, for the CSV table. This first line consists of a comma-separated list of strings, and each string corresponds to a field name. The schema ends when a newline character is reached. Each line following the schema line contains comma-separated field values, and each of these subsequent lines is translated by makeresults into an individual event. Use newlines to indicate the end of one event and the beginning of another. Here is an example of CSV-formatted data: Inline datasets cannot exceed a threshold of 29,999 characters. If makeresults cannot parse the data for the specified format, it returns an error.", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults format=json data=\"[{\\\"name\\\":\\\"John\\\", \\\"age\\\":35}, {\\\"name\\\":\\\"Sarah\\\", \\\"age\\\":39}]\""}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults format=csv data=\"name, age\nJohn,35\nSarah,39\""}], "tables": [], "chunk_index": 2, "total_chunks": 6, "metadata": {"title": "makeresults", "section_heading": "Usage", "section_id": "id_2888f8c3_eb65_42f0_a562_940c792588e0--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/search-commands/makeresults", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Search Commands", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T14:08:43.039270+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

{"id": "6b6d79db67010dea", "content": "1. Create daily results for testing You can use the makeresults command to create a series of results to test your search syntax. For example, the following search creates a set of five results: The results look something like this: Each result has the same timestamp which, by itself, is not very useful. But with a few additions, you can create a set of unique dates. Start by adding the streamstats command to count your results: The results look something like this: You can now use that count to create different dates in the _time field, using the eval command. The calculation multiplies the value in the count field by the number of seconds in a day. The result is subtracted from the original _time field to get new dates equivalent to 24 hours ago, 48 hours ago, and so forth. The seconds in the date are different because _time is calculated the moment you run the search. The results look something like this: The dates start from the day before the original date, 2020-01-09, and go back five days. Need more than five results? Simply change the count value in the makeresults command. 2. Create hourly results for testing You can create a series of hours instead of a series of days for testing. Use 3600, the number of seconds in an hour, instead of 86400 in the eval command. The results look something like this: Notice that the hours in the timestamp are 1 hour apart. 3. Add a field with string values You can specify a list of values for a field. But to have the values appear in separate results, you need to make the list a multivalue field and then expand that multivalued list into separate results. Use this search, substituting your strings for buttercup and her friends: The results look something like this: 4. Create a set of events with multiple fields Let's start by creating a set of four events. One of the events contains a null value in the age field. The streamstats command is used to create the count field. The streamstats command calculates a cumulative count for each event, at the time the event is processed. The eval command is used to create two new fields, age and city. The eval command uses the value in the count field. The case function takes pairs of arguments, such as count=1, 25. The first argument is a Boolean expression. When that expression is TRUE, the corresponding second argument is returned. The results of the search look like this: In this example, the eventstats command generates the average age for each city. The generated averages are placed into a new field called avg(age). The following search is the same as the previous search, with the eventstats command added at the end: For San Francisco , the average age is 28 = (25 + 31) / 2. For Seattle , there is only one event with a value. The average is 39 = 39 / 1. The eventstats command places that average in every event for Seattle, including events that did not contain a value for age. The results of the search look like this: 5. Add a field with a set of random numbers If you need to test something with a set of numbers, you have two options: You can add a field with a set of numbers that you specify. This is similar to adding a field with a set of string values, which is shown in the previous example. You can add a field with a set of randomly generated numbers by using the random function, as shown below: The results look something like this: Use the round function to round the numbers up. For example, this search rounds the numbers up to four digits to the right of the decimal: The results look something like this: 6. Generate a table of results from JSON-formatted data This makeresults search provides a JSON array of objects with the names and ages of a set of individuals. makeresults transforms this JSON object array into a result table where the keys have been turned into fields and the values have been transformed into field values.

The file must end with .csv or .csv.gz. tablename Syntax: <string> Description: The name of the lookup table as specified by a stanza name in transforms.conf , which corresponds to the lookup definition. The lookup table can be configured for any lookup type (CSV, external, or KV store). If your lookup file and the lookup definition that it is associated with have the same name, you can provide a tablename that is the same value as the corresponding filename without the .csv extension. For example, say you have a lookup file named staff.csv. If you associate that file with a lookup called staff , you can use either staff.csv or staff as the tablename with the outputlookup command. See Create a CSV lookup definition in the Splunk Enterprise Knowledge Manager Manual. Optional arguments allow_updates Syntax: allow_updates=<bool> Description: The allow_updates argument is set to true by default if either the append argument is set to true or if the key_field argument is set to a valid field name. If allow_updates is set to true , the outputlookup command updates existing records and inserts new records. If allow_updates is set to false , the outputlookup only inserts records. append Syntax: append=<bool> Description: The default setting, append=false , writes the search results to the .csv file or KV store collection. Fields that are not in the current search results are removed from the file. If append=true , the outputlookup command attempts to append search results to an existing .csv file or KV store collection. Otherwise, it creates a file. If there is an existing .csv file, the outputlookup command writes only the fields that are present in the previously existing .csv file. An outputlookup search that is run with append=true might result in a situation where the lookup table or collection is only partially updated. This means that a subsequent lookup or inputlookup search on that lookup table or collection might return stale data along with new data. The outputlookup command cannot append to .gz files. Default: false create_context Syntax: create_context= app | user | system Description: Specifies where the lookup table file is created. Ignored in favor of the createinapp argument if both arguments are used in the search. See Usage for details. Default: app create_empty Syntax: create_empty=<bool> Description: If set to true and there are no results, a zero-length file is created. When set to false and there are no results, no file is created. If the file previously existed, the file is deleted. For example, suppose there is a system-level lookup called \"test\" with the lookup defined in \"test.csv\". There is also an app-level lookup with the same name. If an app overrides that \"test.csv\" in it's own app directory with an empty file create_empty=true , the app-level lookup behaves as if the lookup is empty. However, if there's no file at all create_empty=false at the app level, then the lookup file in the system-level is used. Default: false createinapp Syntax: createinapp=<bool> Description: Specifies whether the lookup table file is created in the system directory or the lookups directory for the current app context. Overrides the create_context argument if both arguments are used in the search. See Usage for details. Default: true key_field Syntax: key_field=<field> Description: For KV store-based lookups, uses the specified field name as the key to a value and replaces that value. An outputlookup search using the key_field argument might result in a situation where the lookup table or collection is only partially updated. A subsequent lookup or inputlookup search on that collection might return stale data along with new data. A partial update only occurs with concurrent searches, one with the outputlookup command and a search with the inputlookup command. It is possible that the inputlookup occurs when the outputlookup is still updating some of the records. When key_field is used in an outputlookup search, by default, append is set to true , which appends search results to an existing KV store collection. You can override this default behavior by directly setting key_field with append set to false. max Syntax: max=<int> Description: Specifies whether there is a limit to the number of rows to output to a CSV file or a KV store collection. For example, to write 50,000 rows to a CSV file or KV store collection, set max=50000 in your outputlookup search. Default: no limit output_format Syntax: output_format=splunk_sv_csv | splunk_mv_csv Description: Controls the output data format of the lookup. Use output_format=splunk_mv_csv when you want to output multivalued fields to a lookup table file, and then read the fields back into Splunk using the inputlookup command. The default, splunk_sv_csv outputs a CSV file which excludes the _mv_<fieldname> fields. Default: splunk_sv_csv override_if_empty Syntax: override_if_empty=<bool> Description: If override_if_empty=true and no results are passed to the output file, the existing output file is deleted, If override_if_empty=false and no results are passed to the output file, the command does not delete the existing output file.

{"id": "c3c206013d9acdc1", "content": "The lookup table must be a CSV or GZ file, or a table name specified with a lookup table configuration in transforms.conf. The lookup table can refer to a KV store collection or a CSV lookup. The outputlookup command cannot be used with external lookups. If you specify a lookup table file name with the .gz extension, the file that's created is compressed. Determine where the lookup table file is created For CSV lookups, outputlookup creates a lookup table file for the results of the search. There are three locations where outputlookup can put the file it creates: The system lookups directory: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/lookups The lookups directory for the current app context: $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<app>/lookups The app-based lookups directory for the user running the search: etc/users/<user>/<app>/lookups You can use the createinapp or create_context arguments to determine where outputlookup creates the lookup table for a given search. If you try to use both of these arguments in the same search, createinapp argument overrides the create_context argument. If you do not use either argument in your search, the create_context setting in limits.conf determines where outputlookup creates the lookup table file. This setting defaults to app if there is an app context when you run the search, or to system , if there is not an app context when you run the search. To have outputlookup create the lookup table file in the system lookups directory, set createinapp=false or set create_context=system. Alternatively, if you do not have an app context when you run the search, leave both arguments out of the search and rely on the limits.conf version of create_context to put the lookup table file in the system directory. This last approach only works if the create_context setting in limits.conf has not been set to user. To have outputlookup create the lookup table file in the lookups directory for the current app context, set createinapp=true or set create_context=app. Alternatively, if you do have an app context when you run the search, leave both arguments out of the search and rely on the limits.conf version of create_context to put the lookup table file in the app directory. This last approach only works if the create_context setting in limits.conf has not been set to user. To have outputlookup create the lookup table file in the lookups directory for the user running the search, set create_context=user. Alternatively, if you want all outputlookup searches to create lookup table files in user lookup directories by default, you can set create_context=user in limits.conf. The createinapp and create_context arguments can override this setting if they are used in the search. Note: If the lookup table file already exists in the location to which it is written, the existing version of the file is overwritten with the results of the outputlookup search. Restrict write access to lookup table files with check_permission For permissions in CSV lookups in Splunk Enterprise deployments, use the check_permission field in transforms.conf and outputlookup_check_permission in limits.conf to restrict write access to users with the appropriate permissions when using the outputlookup command. Both check_permission and outputlookup_check_permission default to false, which means that, by default, Splunk software doesn't perform any permissions checks. As a result, all users can write to lookup table files, regardless of their capabilities. To ensure that only users who have the admin or power role can write to a shared CSV lookup file by default, instruct Splunk software to verify permission settings for lookups for users by setting check_permission and outputlookup_check_permission to true. Note that the permission checks are performed only after the lookup stanza has been created. You can change lookup table file permissions in the .meta file for each lookup file, or Settings > Lookups > Lookup table files. For more information about creating lookups, see About lookups in the Knowledge Manager Manual. For more information about App Key Value Store collections, see About KV store in the Admin Manual. Append results Suppose you have an existing CSV file that contains fields A, D, and J. The results of your search are fields A, C, and J. If you run a search with outputlookup append=false , then fields A, C, and J are written to the CSV file. Field D is not retained. If you run a search with outputlookup append=true , then only the fields that are currently in the file are preserved. In this example, fields A and J are written to the CSV file. Field C is lost because it does not already exist in the CSV file. Field D is retained. You can work around this issue by using the eval command to add a field to your CSV file before you run the search. For example, if your CSV file is named users , you would do something like this: Then run your search and pipe the results to the fields command for the fields in the file that you want to preserve. Multivalued fields When you output to a static lookup table, the outputlookup command merges values in a multivalued field into single space-delimited value. This does not apply to a KV store collection.", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "| inputlookup users |evalc=null | outputlookup users append=false...."}, {"language": "spl", "code": "... | fields A C J | outputlookup append=trueusers"}], "tables": [], "chunk_index": 2, "total_chunks": 5, "metadata": {"title": "outputlookup", "section_heading": "Usage", "section_id": "id_8dfbccc7_556e_457b_8b53_6e5928787e53--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/search-commands/outputlookup", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Search Commands", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T14:09:00.449914+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

This collection is referenced in a lookup table called kvstorecoll_lookup. 5. Overwrite KV store collections By default, append is set to true when the key_field is used with the outputlookup command. If you don't want to append search results to an existing KV store collection, you can override the default behavior by directly setting key_field with append=false. For example, in the following outputlookup search, the KV store called accounts is appended. This is because key_field sets append=true by default. However, in the following outputlookup search, the KV store called accounts is overwritten because append=false. In this case, the append subsearch runs before the main search, which empties the entire KV store before the fields are written to accounts. Alternatively, if you want your entire lookup to reflect your search results and you don't mind using the default system-generated keys, eliminate key_field=key from your outputlookup search, like this. 6.

An example .form file might look like this: Specifying a form If the form argument is specified, the kvform command uses the <form_name>.form file found in the Splunk configuration forms directory. For example, if form=sales_order , the kvform command looks for a sales_order.form file in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<app_name>/forms directory for all apps. All the events processed are matched against the form, trying to extract values. Specifying a field If you specify the field argument, the the kvform command looks for forms in the forms directory that correspond to the values for that field. For example, if you specify field=error_code , and an event has the field value error_code=404 , the command looks for a form called 404.form in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<app_name>/forms directory. Default value If no form or field argument is specified, the kvform command uses the default value for the field argument, which is sourcetype. The kvform command looks for <sourcetype_value>.form files to extract values.", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "Students Name: [[string:student_name]]\nAge: [[int:age]] Zip: [[int:zip]]"}], "tables": [], "chunk_index": 2, "total_chunks": 5, "metadata": {"title": "kvform", "section_heading": "Usage", "section_id": "id_2e29a92e_1bc6_45ea_ac4d_0e9cbb3d8393--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/search-commands/kvform", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Search Commands", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T14:09:17.312307+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

{"id": "145b0cedaa315064", "content": "The foreach command is a streaming command. You can use the foreach command in the following ways: To obtain results across multiple fields in each result row. This is useful, for example, when you need to calculate the average or sum of a value across multiple columns in each row. If you want to iterate over one or more matching fields, use the multifield mode. To iterate over multiple values within a single row's field in multivalue fields or JSON arrays. This is useful, for example, when you need to concatenate strings or calculate the average or sum of a set of numbers in a single field across multiple columns in each row in a multivalue field or JSON array. If you want to iterate over a multivalue field, use the multivalue mode. If you want to iterate over a JSON array node, use the json_array mode. The default <<ITEM>> template value should be used only when the mode is multivalue or json_array. Supported commands The foreach command with mode=multifield supports searches with any streaming command. The foreach command with all other modes ( mode=auto_collections , mode=multivalue , or mode=json_array ) only supports searches with the eval command. Iterating over multiple matching fields containing nonalphanumeric characters If the field names contain characters other than alphanumeric characters, such as dashes, underscores, or periods, enclose the <<FIELD>> template value in single quotation marks in the right side of the eval command portion of the search to avoid unpredictable results. For example, the following search uses the default foreach multifield mode and adds the values from all of the fields that match myfield_*. The search results look something like this: The <<FIELD>> template value in the foreach subsearch is just a string replacement of the field named myfield_*. The eval expression does not recognize field names with nonalphanumeric characters unless the field names are surrounded by single quotation marks. For the eval expression to work, the <<FIELD>> template value must be surrounded by single quotation marks. Support for multiple eval statements If you need to include multiple eval statements with the foreach command, use the default multifield mode. Multiple eval statements are not supported in foreach searches that use multivalue mode or JSON array mode. As a result, your searches on multivalue fields or JSON arrays must contain only a single eval statement in the pipeline. However, your eval statement can include as many assignments as you want. For example, the following multivalue search with multiple eval assignments completes successfully because there is only one eval statement, which means there aren't any piped commands following the eval command. The search results look something like this. Wildcards are not supported in multivalue fields or JSON arrays Unlike multifield mode, the modes for multivalue fields and JSON arrays don't support wildcards in search expressions. Instead, these modes treat a wildcard as part of the field name. For example, the following search includes a field called mv* , which looks like a wildcarded field. However, multivalue and JSON array modes don't recognize the wildcard and add up all of the fields containing mv. As a result, the search results for multivalue mode look something like this: Elements of the same type in multivalue fields or JSON arrays Elements in a subsearch and the eval expression must be of the same type as either strings or numbers. For example, the following search correctly adds up the three numbers in the JSON array because all of the elements are numbers. However, the following search results in an error because adding a number to a string isn't allowed.", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults\n|evalmyfield_1 = 5, myfield_2 = 10\n| foreach myfield_* \n       [eval<<FIELD>> = '<<FIELD>>' + <<MATCHSTR>>]"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults\n|evalmv=mvappend(\"5\",\"15\"), total = 0, count = 0\n| foreach mode=multivalue mv\n     [evaltotal = total + <<ITEM>>, count = count + 1]"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalmv1=mvappend(\"1\",\"2\"), mv2=mvappend(\"3\",\"4\"), mv*=mvappend(\"100\",\"300\"), total = 0\n| foreach mode=multivalue mv* \n     [evaltotal = total + <<ITEM>>]"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| foreach json_array(1, 2, 3) \n     [evaltotal = total + <<ITEM>>]"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| foreach json_array(1, 2,\"hello\") \n     [evaltotal = total + <<ITEM>>]"}], "tables": [{"headers": ["_time", "myfield_1", "myfield_2"], "rows": [["2023-3-14 15:55:50", "6", "12"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "count", "mv", "total"], "rows": [["2022-03-29 19:52:38", "2", "515", "20"]]}, {"headers": ["_time", "mv*", "mv1", "mv2", "total"], "rows": [["2022-4-20 15:55:50", "100300", "12", "34", "400"]]}], "chunk_index": 2, "total_chunks": 5, "metadata": {"title": "foreach", "section_heading": "Usage", "section_id": "id_6e26743b_1a2e_4e51_9356_5faa128643c9--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/search-commands/foreach", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Search Commands", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T14:10:54.858640+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

It uses the foreach command with the default multifield mode The results of the search look something like this. This search creates one result using the makeresults command. The search then uses the eval command to create the fields total , test1 , test2 , and test3 with corresponding values. The foreach command is used to perform the subsearch for every field that starts with \"test\". Each time the subsearch is run, the previous total is added to the value of the test field to calculate the new total. The final total after all of the test fields are processed is 6. The following table shows how the subsearch iterates over each test field. The table shows the beginning value of the total field each time the subsearch is run and the calculated total based on the value for the test field. 3. Iterate over fields using the eval and foreach commands The eval command and foreach command can be used in similar ways. For example, this search uses the eval command: It is equivalent to this search that uses the foreach command with the default multifield mode: The results of both searches look something like this: 4. Monitor license usage Use the foreach command to monitor license usage. First run the following search on the license manager to return the daily license usage per source type in bytes: The search results for one user across several days looks something like this: You can also use the foreach command with the default multifield mode to calculate the daily license usage in gigabytes for each field: This time the search results look something like this: 5. Use the MATCHSTR template value In this example, the <<FIELD>> template value is a placeholder for test , and the <<MATCHSTR>> template value represents the wildcarded value that follows test in each field name in the eval expression. This example uses the default multifield mode. The results look something like this: The value of each field is added to the value that replaces the wildcard in the field name. For example, for the test1 field, 5 + 1 = 6. 6. Use the MATCHSEG1 and MATCHSEG2 template values This example uses the default multifield mode. The matchseg1 and matchseg2 options are used to add each field value to the two values represented by the wildcard in the corresponding <<MATCHSEG1>> and <<MATCHSEG2>> template values. Let's take a closer look at the syntax for the test1ab2=5 eval expression: The wildcard field is test*ab*. The <<FIELD>> template value called MYFIELD is test1ab2=5. The field value is 5. The <<MATCHSEG1>> template value called SEG1 is 1. The <<MATCHSEG2>> template value called SEG2 is 2. The results of the search look something like this: The value of the test1ab2 field in the search results is 8 because 5 + 1 + 2 = 8. 7. Add values in a multivalue field using the auto_collections mode In this example using the auto_collections mode, <<ITEM>> is a placeholder for each number in the multivalue field, which is added to the total. The results of the search look something like this. The previous search produces similar results as the following eval search, which also displays the total, but without listing each of the values that make up the total. The search results look like this: 8. Calculate grade averages using multivalue fields To find the average of a set of student grades using the multivalue mode, you could run this search: The search results look something like this: 9. Add values in a JSON array If you want to do something simple like add up each element in a JSON array, you could run a search like this: The search results look like this: 10. Categorize employees by manager using multivalue fields You can create lists of employee names and organize them by manager using the eval command or the foreach command. This is an example of a search on employees and their manager using the eval command: The results of the eval search look something like this. To create multivalue fields of employee names and organize them by manager, you can run a similar search using multivalue fields with the foreach command: The search results this time look like this: 11. Add values to a JSON array Now let's take the names of the employees in a multivalue field and append them to a JSON array. In this search, the employees_array is empty. The search results look like this: To copy all the values from the multivalue field into json_array() , use foreach to iterate over the employees values and append each of the employee names to the array, like this search: Now the search results look like this: The foreach command just copied over each of the employees' names to the JSON array. 12. Extracting values from a JSON array What if you want to extract values for given key names from a JSON array and do something with them? For example, the following search extracts a list of employee IDs from a JSON array of employees and puts them in a new field called ID_array that you can use for other operations. The results of this search look something like this: 13. Multiplying elements in a JSON array You can use the foreach command to multiply numbers and append to a JSON array in searches like this: The results look something like this: This search doubles each value in the array in price and then adds the values to a new array called double_price. 14. Calculating weights To find the weights of values in a JSON array called grades , you could run a search like this: The search results look something like this: 15. Iterate over multivalue fields and concatenate the values The following example iterates over multivalue fields and concatenates the values, so that each letter is added to the index value in the search results. The search results look like this:", "code_examples": [{"language": "spl", "code": "...|evaltotal=0\n| foreach www* \n     [evaltotal=total + <<FIELD>>]"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults\n|evaltotal=0, test1=1, test2=2, test3=3 \n| foreachtest* \n     [evaltotal=total + <<FIELD>>]"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults\n|evalname=\"name\"|evalprice=\"price\"|evalcategory=\"category\""}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n| foreach name price category \n     [eval<<FIELD>> = \"<<FIELD>>\"]"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "index=_internalsource=*license_usage.logtype!=\"*Summary\"earliest=-30d\n| timechart span=1d sum(b) AS daily_bytes by st"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "index=_internalsource=*license_usage.logtype!=\"*Summary\"earliest=-30d\n| timechart span=1d sum(b) AS daily_bytes by st\n| foreach * [eval<<FIELD>>='<<FIELD>>'/1024/1024/1024]"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults\n|evaltest1 = 5, test2 = 10\n| foreachtest* [eval<<FIELD>> = <<FIELD>> + <<MATCHSTR>>]"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults\n|evaltest1ab2=5, test2ab3=10\n| foreachtest*ab* fieldstr=MYFIELD matchseg1=SEG1 matchseg2=SEG2 \n     [evalMYFIELD = MYFIELD + SEG1 + SEG2]"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalmvfield=mvappend(\"1\",\"2\",\"3\"), total=0 \n| foreach mode=auto_collections\n     [evaltotal = total + <<ITEM>>] \n| table mvfield, total"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults\n|evaltotal = 0\n|evaltotal = total + 1 \n|evaltotal = total + 2 \n|evaltotal = total + 3"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalteacher=\"James\", student_grades=mvappend(\"50\",\"100\",\"30\"), sum = 0, count = 0\n| foreach mode=multivalue student_grades\n    [evalsum = sum + <<ITEM>>, count = count + 1]\n| eval average = sum / count"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evaljsonfield=json_array(1, 2, 3), total=0 \n| foreach mode=json_array jsonfield \n     [evaltotal = total + <<ITEM>>] \n| table jsonfield, total"}, {"language": "spl", "code": "| makeresults \n|evalmanager=\"Rutherford\", employees=mvappend(\"Alex\",\"Claudia\",\"David\")\n| fields -

When only the data model is specified, the search returns the JSON for the single data model. dataset name Syntax: <string> Description: The name of a data model dataset to search. Must be specified after the data model name. The search returns the JSON for the single dataset. data model search mode Syntax: <data model search result mode> | <data model search string mode> Description: You can use datamodel to run a search against a data model or a data model dataset that returns either results or a search string. If you want to do this, you must provide a <data model search mode>. There are two <data model search mode> subcategories: modes that return results and modes that return search strings. See Data model search mode options. allow_old_summaries Syntax: allow_old_summaries=<bool> Description: This argument applies only to accelerated data models. When you change the constraints that define a data model but the Splunk software has not fully updated the summaries to reflect that change, the summaries may have some data that matches the old definition and some data that matches the new definition. By default, allow_old_summaries = false , which means that the search head does not use summary directories that are older than the new summary definition. This ensures that the datamodel search results always reflect your current configuration. When you set allow_old_summaries = true , datamodel uses both current summary data and summary data that was generated prior to the definition change. You can set allow_old_summaries=true in your search if you feel that the old summary data is close enough to the new summary data that its results are reliable. Default: false summariesonly Syntax: summariesonly=<bool> Description: This argument applies only to accelerated data models. When set to false, the datamodel search returns both summarized and unsummarized data for the selected data model. When set to true, the search returns results only from the data that has been summarized in TSIDX format for the selected data model. You can use this argument to identify what data is currently summarized for a given data model, or to ensure that a particular data model search runs efficiently. Default: false strict_fields Syntax: strict_fields=<bool> Description: Determines the scope of the datamodel search in terms of fields returned. When strict_fields=true , the search returns only default fields and fields that are included in the constraints of the specified data model dataset. When strict_fields=false , the search returns all fields defined in the data model, including fields inherited from parent data model datasets, extracted fields, calculated fields, and fields derived from lookups. You can also arrange for strict_fields to default to false for a specific data model. See Design data models in the Knowledge Manager Manual.

{"id": "df842fa4ada72e51", "content": "The fields command is a distributable streaming command. See Command types. Internal fields and Splunk Web The leading underscore is reserved for names of internal fields such as _raw and _time. By default, the internal fields _raw and _time are included in the search results in Splunk Web. The fields command does not remove these internal fields unless you explicitly specify that the fields should not appear in the output in Splunk Web. For example, to remove all internal fields, you specify: ... | fields - _* To exclude a specific field, such as _raw , you specify: ... | fields - _raw Note: Be cautious removing the _time field. Statistical commands, such as timechart and chart , cannot display date or time information without the _time field. Displaying internal fields in Splunk Web Other than the _raw and _time fields, internal fields do not display in Splunk Web, even if you explicitly specify the fields in the search. For example, the following search does not show the _bkt field in the results. To display an internal field in the results, the field must be copied or renamed to a field name that does not include the leading underscore character. For example: Internal fields and the outputcsv command You can include additional internal fields in your search results by using the <codeph>outputcsv</codeph> command. When the outputcsv command is used in the search, there are additional internal fields that are automatically added to the CSV file. The most common internal fields that are added are: _raw _time _indextime To exclude internal fields from the output, specify each field that you want to exclude. For example: You cannot match wildcard characters in searches that use the fields command You can use the asterisk ( * ) in your searches as a wildcard character, but you can't use a backslash ( \\ ) to escape an asterisk in search strings. A backslash \\ and an asterisk * match the characters \\* in searches, not an escaped wildcard * character. Because Splunk platform doesn't support escaping wildcards, asterisk ( * ) characters in field names can't be matched in searches that keep or remove fields from search results. Support for backslash characters ( \\ ) in the fields command To match a backslash character ( \\ ) in a field name when using the fields command, use 2 backslashes for each backslash.

Default: 100 minspan Syntax: minspan=<span-length> Description: Specifies the smallest span granularity to use automatically inferring span from the data time range. span Syntax: span = <log-span> | <span-length> Description: Sets the size of each bin, using a span length based on a logarithm-based span or based on time. Note: When a <span-length> of a day or more is used, the span is aligned to midnight in the timezone of the user. <start-end> Syntax: start=<num> | end=<num> Description: Sets the minimum and maximum extents for numerical bins.

{"id": "fda24a5b2b38c109", "content": "The walklex command is a generating command , which use a leading pipe character. The walklex command must be the first command in a search. See Command types. When the Splunk software indexes event data, it segments each event into raw tokens using rules specified in segmenters.conf file. You might end up with raw tokens that are actually key-value pairs separated by an arbitrary delimiter such as an equal ( = ) symbol. The following search uses the walklex and where commands to find the raw tokens in your index. It uses the stats command to count the raw tokens. Return only indexed field names Specify the type=field argument to have walklex return only the field names from indexed fields. The indexed fields returned by walklex can include default fields such as host , source , sourcetype , the date_* fields, punct , and so on. It can also include additional indexed fields configured as such in props.conf and transforms.conf and created with the INDEXED_EXTRACTIONS setting or other WRITE_META methods. The discovery of this last set of additional indexed fields is likely to help you with accelerating your searches. Return the set of terms that are indexed fields with indexed values Specify type=fieldvalue argument to have walklex return the set of terms from the index that are indexed fields with indexed values. The type=fieldvalue argument returns the list terms from the index that are indexed fields with indexed values. Unlike the type=field argument, where the values returned are only the field names themselves, the type=fieldvalue argument returns indexed field names that have any field value. For example, if the indexed field term is runtime::0.04 , the value returned by the type=fieldvalue argument is runtime::0.04. The value returned by the type=field argument is runtime. Return all TSIDX keywords that are not part of an indexed field structure Specify type=term to have walklex return the keywords from the TSIDX files that are not part of any indexed field structure. In other words, it excludes all indexed field terms of the form <field>::<value>. Return terms of all three types When you do not specify a type, or when you specify type=all , walklex uses the default type=all argument. This causes walklex to return the terms in the index of all three types: field , fieldvalue , and term. Note: When you use type=all , the indexed fields are not called out as explicitly as the fields are with the type=field argument. You need to split the term field on :: to obtain the field values from the indexed term. Support for hot buckets Because the walklex command doesn't work on hot buckets, recently loaded data displays in search results only after buckets have rolled over from hot to warm. You can either wait for buckets of an index to roll over from hot to warm on their own, or you can restart Splunk platform or manually roll the buckets over to warm. See Rolling buckets manually from hot to warm. Restrictions The walklex command applies only to event indexes. It cannot be used with metrics indexes. People who have search filters applied to one or more of their roles cannot use walklex unless they also have a role with either the run_walklex capability or the admin_all_objects capability.

Convert all events returned by a search into JSON objects This search of index=_internal converts all events it returns for its time range into JSON-formatted data. Because the search string does not assign datatype functions to specific fields, by default tojson applies the none datatype function to all fields returned by the search. This means all of their values get either the numeric or string datatypes. For example, say you start with events that look like this: After being processed by tojson , such events have JSON formatting like this: 2. Specify different datatypes for 'date' fields The following search of the _internal index converts results into JSON objects that have only the date_* fields from each event. The numeric datatype is applied to all date_hour field values. The string datatype is applied to all other date field values. This search produces JSON objects like this: Note that all fields that do not start with date_ have been stripped from the output. 3. Limit JSON object output and apply datatypes to the field values This search returns JSON objects only for the name , age , and isRegistered fields. It uses the auto datatype function to have tojson automatically apply appropriate JSON datatypes to the values of those fields. 4. Convert all events into JSON objects and apply appropriate datatypes to all field values This search converts all of the fields in each event returned by the search into JSON objects. It uses the auto datatype function in conjunction with a wildcard to apply appropriate datatypes to the values of all fields returned by the search. Notice that this search references the auto datatype function, which ensures that Boolean, JSON, and null field values are appropriately typed alongside numeric and string values. Alternatively, you can use default_type to apply the auto datatype function to all fields returned by a search: 5. Apply the Boolean datatype to a specific field This example generates JSON objects containing values of the isInternal field. It uses the bool datatype function to apply the Boolean datatype to those field values. 6. Include internal fields and assign a 'null' value to skipped fields This example demonstrates usage of the include_internal and fill_null arguments. 7. Designate a default datatype for a set of fields and write the JSON objects to another field This search generates JSON objects based on the values of four fields. It uses the default_type argument to convert the first three fields to the num datatype. It applies the string datatype to a fourth field.

Suppose you run a search like this: The search produces the following search results: When you add the transpose command to the end of the search, the results look something like this: 2. Specifying a header field In the previous example, the default settings for the transpose command are used in the search: The results look like this: Instead of using the default field names like row 1, row 2, and so forth, you can use the values in a field for the field names by specifying the header_field argument. The results look like this: 3. Count the number of events by sourcetype and transpose the results to display the 3 highest counts Count the number of events by sourcetype and display the sourcetypes with the highest count first. Use the transpose command to convert the rows to columns and show the source types with the 3 highest counts. 4. Transpose a set of data into a series to produce a chart Search all successful events and count the number of views, the number of times items were added to the cart, and the number of purchases. This search produces a single row of data. Note: The value for count AS views is the total number of the events that match the criteria sourcetype=access_* status=200 , or the total count for all actions. The values for addtocart and purchases show the number of events for those specific actions. When you switch to the Visualization tab, the data displays a chart with the \"34282 views\" as the X axis label and two columns, one for \"addtocart \"and one for \"purchases\". Because the information about the views is placed on the X axis, this chart is confusing. If you change to a pie chart, you see only the \"views\". Use the transpose command to convert the columns of the single row into multiple rows. Now these rows can be displayed in a column or pie chart where you can compare the values. Note: In this particular example, using a pie chart is misleading. The views is a total count of all the actions, not just the addtocart and purchases actions. Using a pie chart implies that views is an action like addtocart and purchases. The pie chart implies that the value for views is 1 part of the total, when in fact views is the total.

{"id": "d0606d8b53751a1b", "content": "The union command is a dataset processing command. See Command types. How the union command processes datasets depends on whether the dataset is a streaming or non-streaming dataset. The type of dataset is determined by the commands that are used to create the dataset. See Types of commands. Note: There are two types of streaming commands, distributable streaming and centralized streaming. For this discussion about the union command, streaming datasets refers to distributable streaming. A subsearch can be initiated through a search command such as the union command. See Initiating subsearches with search commands in the Splunk Cloud Platform Search Manual. Where the command is run Whether the datasets are streaming or non-streaming determines if the union command is run on the indexers or the search head. The following table specifies where the command is run. How the command is processed The type of dataset also determines how the union command is processed. Optimized syntax for streaming datasets With streaming datasets, instead of this syntax: <streaming_dataset1> | union <streaming_dataset2> Your search is more efficient with this syntax: ... | union <streaming_dataset1>, <streaming_dataset2> Why unioned results might be truncated Consider the following search, which uses the union command to merge the events from three indexes. Each index contains 60,000 events, for a total of 180,000 events. This search produces the following union results: In this example, all of the subsearches are distributable streaming, so they are unioned by using same processing as the multisearch command. All 60,000 results for each index are unioned for a total of 180,000 merged events. However, if you specify a centralized streaming command, such as the head command, in one of the subsearches the results change. This search produces the following union results for a total of 160,000 merged events. Because the head command is a centralized streaming command rather than distributable streaming command, any subsearches that follow the head command are processed using the append command. In other words, when a command forces the processing to the search head, all subsequent commands must also be processed on the search head. Internally, the search is converted to this: When the union command is used with commands that are non-streaming commands, the default for the maxout argument is enforced. The default for the maxout argument is 50,000 events. In this example, the default for the maxout argument is enforced starting with the subsearch that used the non-streaming command. The default is enforced for any subsequent subsearches. If the non-streaming command is on the last subsearch, the first two subsearches are processed as streaming. These subsearches are unioned using the multisearch command processing. The final subsearch includes a non-streaming command, the head command. That subsearch gets unioned using the append command processing. Internally this search is converted to this: In this example, the default for the maxout argument applies only to the last subsearch. That subsearch returns only 50,000 events instead of the entire set of 60,000 events. The total number events merged is 170,000. 60,000 events for the first and second subsearches and 50,000 events from the last subsearch. Interleaving results When two datasets are retrieved from disk in descending time order, which is the default sort order, the union command interleaves the results. The interleave is based on the _time field. For example, you have the following datasets: dataset_A dataset_B Both datasets are descending order by _time.

Each table column, which is the series, is 1 week of time. 2. Compare today, yesterday, and average for the week To compare a few days with the weekly average, you need to calculate the daily totals, calculate the weekly average, and remove the days you don't want to use. For example: Use the timewrap command to generate results over the last 7 days. By using the series=short argument, field names are generated in the output which start with \"s\", making it easy to create totals using the addtotals command. Use the addtotals and eval commands to calculate the average over those 7 days. The table command is used to cut out days 3-7 so that only today, yesterday, and the weekly average are returned. The rename command is used to rename the fields. The output looks something like this: 3.

{"id": "bca06653d7d17ffb", "content": "When an event is processed by Splunk software, its timestamp is saved as the default field _time. This timestamp, which is the time when the event occurred, is saved in UNIX time notation. Searching with relative time modifiers, earliest or latest , finds every event with a timestamp beginning, ending, or between the specified timestamps. For example, when you search for earliest=@d , the search finds every event with a _time value since midnight. This example uses @d , which is a date format variable. See Date and time format variables. Time modifiers and the Time Range Picker When you use a time modifier in the SPL syntax, that time overrides the time specified in the Time Range Picker. For example, suppose your search uses yesterday in the Time Range Picker. You add the time modifier earliest=-2d to your search syntax. The search uses the time specified in the time modifier and ignores the time in the Time Range Picker. Because the search does not specify the latest time modifier, the default value now is used for latest. For more information, see Specify time modifiers in your search in the Search Manual. Time ranges and subsearches Time ranges selected from the Time Range Picker apply to the base search and to subsearches. However, time ranges specified directly in the base search do not apply to subsearches. Likewise, a time range specified directly in a subsearch applies only to that subsearch. The time range does not apply to the base search or any other subsearch. For example, if the Time Range Picker is set to Last 7 days and a subsearch contains earliest=2d@d , then the earliest time modifier applies only to the subsearch and Last 7 days applies to the base search. Searching based on index time You also have the option of searching for events based on when they were indexed. The UNIX time is saved in the _indextime field. Similar to earliest and latest for the _time field, you can use the relative time modifiers _index_earliest and _index_latest to search for events based on _indextime. For example, if you wanted to search for events indexed in the previous hour, use: _index_earliest=-h@h _index_latest=@h. Note: When using index-time based modifiers such as _index_earliest and _index_latest , your search must also have an event-time window which will retrieve the events. In other words, chunks of events might be ruled out based on the non index-time window as well as the index-time window.

{"id": "8713b9365bb311fd", "content": "You can define the relative time in your search with a string of characters that indicate time amount (integer and unit). You can also specify a \"snap to\" time unit, which is specified with the @ symbol followed by a time unit. The syntax for using time modifiers is [+|-]<time_integer><time_unit>@<time_unit> The steps to specify a relative time modifier are: Indicate the time offset from the current time. Define the time amount, which is a number and a unit. Specify a \"snap to\" time unit. The time unit indicates the nearest or latest time to which your time amount rounds down. When a relative time modifier is processed, the offset is processed first, followed by the snap-to time. For example, if the relative time modifier is -2h@h the offset -2h is processed first. Then the snap-to time @h is processed. Indicate the time offset Begin your time offset with a plus (+) or minus (-) to indicate the offset from the current time. Define the time amount Define your time amount with a number and a time unit. The supported time units are listed in the following table: For example, to start your search an hour ago, use either of the following time modifiers. earliest=-h or earliest=-60m When specifying single time amounts, the number one is implied. An 's' is the same as '1s', 'm' is the same as '1m', 'h' is the same as '1h', and so forth. Note: Subsecond time units such as ms can be used in metrics searches only when they are searching over metrics indexes that are enabled for millisecond timestamp resolution. For more information about enabling metrics indexes to index metric data points with millisecond timestamp precision: For Splunk Cloud Platform, see Manage Splunk Cloud Platform indexes in the Splunk Cloud Platform Admin Manual. For Splunk Enterprise, see Create custom indexes in Managing indexers and clusters of indexers. Specify a snap to time unit You can specify a snap to time unit. The time unit indicates the nearest or latest time to which your time amount rounds down. Separate the time amount from the \"snap to\" time unit with an \"@\" character. You can use any of time units listed previously. For example: @w, @week, and @w0 for Sunday @month for the beginning of the month @q, @qtr, or @quarter for the beginning of the most recent quarter (Jan 1, Apr 1, Jul 1, or Oct 1). You can specify a day of the week: w0 (Sunday), w1, w2, w3, w4, w5 and w6 (Saturday). For Sunday, you can specify w0 or w7. You can also specify offsets from the snap-to-time or \"chain\" together the time modifiers for more specific relative time definitions. For example, @d-2h snaps to the beginning of today (12 AM or midnight), and then applies the time offset of -2h, This results in a time of 10 PM yesterday. The Splunk platform always applies the offset before it applies the snap. In other words, the left-hand side of the @ symbol is applied before the right-hand side. When snapping to the nearest or latest time, Splunk software always snaps backwards or rounds down to the latest time not after the specified time. For example, if it is 11:59:00 and you \"snap to\" hours, you will snap to 11:00 not 12:00. If you do not specify a time offset before the \"snap to\" amount, Splunk software interprets the time as \"current time snapped to\" the specified amount. For example, if it is currently 11:59 PM on Friday and you use @w6 to \"snap to Saturday\", the resulting time is the previous Saturday at 12:01 A.M.", "code_examples": [], "tables": [{"headers": ["Time unit", "Valid unit abbreviations"], "rows": [["subseconds", "microseconds (us), milliseconds (ms), centiseconds (cs), or deciseconds (ds)"], ["second", "s, sec, secs, second, seconds"], ["minute", "m, min, mins, minute, minutes"], ["hour", "h, hr, hrs, hour, hours"], ["day", "d, day, days"], ["week", "w, week, weeks"], ["month", "mon, month, months"], ["quarter", "q, qtr, qtrs, quarter, quarters"], ["year", "y, yr, yrs, year, years"]]}], "chunk_index": 2, "total_chunks": 6, "metadata": {"title": "Time modifiers", "section_heading": "How to specify relative time modifiers", "section_id": "f6b51910_831b_4b80_9728_343ed65e2b80--en", "url": "https://help.splunk.com/en/splunk-enterprise/search/spl-search-reference/10.2/time-format-variables-and-modifiers/time-modifiers", "breadcrumb": "Splunk Enterprise > Search > SPL Search Reference > Time Format Variables and Modifiers", "manual": "spl-search-reference", "scraped_at": "2026-01-23T14:21:52.317344+00:00", "version": "10.2"}}

{"id": "8fbe062bd22517f1", "content": "Splunk software performance is expected to be acceptable as long as the indexers are not currently heavily loaded and do not have more than a few concurrent real-time searches. CAUTION: Real-time searches will have a significant impact on performance in high volume environments and network load when you have many concurrent real-time searches. When planning your real-time searches, you should consider how it will affect the performance of both: The search peer that must stream the live events. The search head that must process the aggregated stream of live events. The more work that is done on the search peer, the less that is required on the search head, and vice versa. The search peer is important to the overall system function, so you do not want to burden it with too much filtering of live events. However, if the search peer does not filter at all, the processing power and bandwidth required to send all the live events to the search head may prove costly, especially when you have multiple real-time searches running concurrently. In cases where the search head cannot keep up with the search peer, the queue on the index processor will cease to flag events for the search. However, the events will have a sequence number that you can use to tell when and how many events were omitted from search consideration. Concurrent real-time and historical searches You can run real-time and historical searches concurrently, within the limits of your hardware. There are no restrictions on separate searches for the same or different users. Concurrent real-time searches Running multiple real-time searches will negatively impact indexing capacity. The real-time search feature is optimized for real-time alerting on sparse, or rare-term, searches and sacrifices indexing capacity for improved latency and reliability. Indexed real-time searches The number of concurrent real-time searches can greatly affect indexing performance. To lessen the impact on the indexer, you can enable indexed real-time search. This will basically run the search like a historical search, but will also continually update it with new events as they appear on disk.

To kick off a real-time search in Splunk Web, use the time range menu to select a preset real-time time range window , such as 30 seconds or 1 minute. You can also specify a sliding time range window to apply to your real-time search. If you have Apache web access data, run the following search to see web traffic events as they stream in. The raw events that are streamed from the input pipeline are not time-ordered. You can use the rtorder command to buffer the events from a real-time search and emit them in ascending time order. The following example keeps a buffer of the last 5 minutes of web traffic events, emitting events in ascending time order once they are more than 5 minutes old. Newly received events that are older than 5 minutes are discarded if an event after that time has already been emitted. Real-time search relies on a stream of events. Thus, you cannot run a real-time search with any other leading search command, such as | metadata which does not produce events or | inputcsv which just reads in a file.

By default the threshold is set to 5 minutes. See Write the script for a custom alert action for Splunk Cloud Platform or Splunk Enterprise in the Developer Guide on the Developer Portal. CAUTION: This command is considered risky because, if used incorrectly, it can pose a security risk or potentially lose data when it runs. As a result, this command triggers SPL safeguards.

If the value of num_of_reducers is set to greater than 5, only five reducers are available due to the limit. If the value of of num_of_reducers is set to less than 5, the number of reducers used shrinks from the maximum limit of 5. The value for num_of_reducers is controlled by two groups of settings: reducers : maxReducersPerPhase + winningRate The number of intermediate reducers is determined by the value set for reducers. If no value is set for reducers , the search uses the values set for maxReducersPerPhase and winningRate to determine the number of intermediate reducers. For example: In a scenario where Splunk is configured so that the value of num_of_reducers is set to 50 percent of the indexer pool and the maxReducersPerPhase value is set to four indexers, a parallel reduce search that runs on six search peers will be assigned to run on three intermediate reducers.
